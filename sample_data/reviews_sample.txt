True wisdom comes from within.The prophet's teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life:&quot;For even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books.

It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the \"strange little book\" or \"the little black book\" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was \"The Counsels\" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as \"the poet-prophet par-excellence\" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, \"extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern.\" Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:\"Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature.

Generations will not exhaust it, but instead, generation after generation will find in the book what they would fain be - and it will be better loved as men grow riper and riper.

Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:\"It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description \"divinely inspired.\"  Brian Bruya\"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own.\"  Claude BragdonPROPHET: LIFE AND TIMES OF KAHLIL GIBRAN", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Gibran's Prophet-worthy Poetic Wisdom", "unixReviewTime": 1259452800, "reviewTime": "11 29, 2009"}

At its simplest, it is a discourse on the human condition: love, work, joy and sorrow, crime and punishment, reason and passion, Gibran runs the gamut of emotion and being, laying bare the paradox of who we are as human beings.  While the tone is somewhat mystical (which I didn't really care for), the sheer poetic beauty of his writing moved me.For example, in the chapter \"Love\", Gibran writes, \"... When love beckons to you, follow him, / Though his ways are hard and steep, / And when his wings enfold you yield to him, / Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you. / And when he speaks to you believe in him, / ... For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.  Even as he is for you growth so is he for your pruning. ...\"  The contrast, vivid metaphor and beautiful images were stunning and left me with much to think and reflect on about my own life, and the choices I've made.  It would be going too far to say that, as a result of reading \"The Prophet\" I've had an epiphany or (to take it to a ridiculous conclusion) some sort of a conversion.  Rather it has caused me to consider on a philosophical level what it is to be human means to me, and how I have demonstrated my \"human-ness\" in my life.Part poetry, part philosophy, it is simultaneously thought-provoking and emotional.

Before he goes, many people have just one question to ask him.  In a very few words, he tells them his accumulated wisdom primarily in a nondenominational way.  The only exceptions come in the references to rebirth.  The essence of each brief lesson is that we have to step outside of our own perspective to see things in the way that God does and wants us to.Let me give you an example.  When someone transgresses either man's laws or God's laws, we tend to condemn the person harshly and focus on punishment.  This is like treating the person as though they have fallen below some level of what it is still to be human.  Yet no one does anything worse than what some person has done wrong before and will do wrong again.Surely, our reaction should still focus, like a Mother's, on the fundamental humanness of the person and our desire to have the person be a contributing, loving, and helpful part of our community.Another way to think about the lessons of The Prophet is to notice that nature loves a balance.  If we interfere with nature, nature overreacts in some new way that counters our interference.  This happens when we put too much phosphate into lakes.  Algae blooms expand exponentially to eat the phosphate.  These lessons help us to see the balance that is missing in our initial reaction.A good parallel can be found in the study of the brain.  Our initial reactions when frightened or threatened are focused in the oldest parts of the brain.  This part of the brain triggers strong chemicals to be released that engage us in &quot;fight or flight&quot; reactions that can save our lives in the near-term.  In the &quot;civilized&quot; world, we often have these reactions just to stress.  Gibran is helping us move to our highest level of consciousness by choosing our reactions, and selecting reactions that integrate all parts of our brains plus our near- and long-term best interests as individuals and as a community.Many Eastern religions encourage one to become free of the conscious mind, and that sense of objectivity is captured nicely here.  I have a feeling much like when meditating while I read The Prophet, because of its calming influence on my overreactive senses.I also think of this perspective like being on the Moon and observing the circumstances on Earth through a telescope.  With such extreme distance should come detachment from the ego, to permit good thinking.But none of these perspectives are directly suggested or alluded to.  The moral lessons are simply there, with the briefest possible examples to make them clear.  As such, they are masterpieces of good thinking, moral ethics, and fine communication.The answers are so brief and so profound that you will want to discuss them.  I suggest you select another member of your family, or a group of people from your house of worship.  The lessons are best explored by discussing tangible situations that you face every day.  Certainly, it is desirable and appropriate to consider the direct teachings of your religious heritage and beliefs in this connection.Whenever you feel overwhelmed, turn to the page in The Prophet that addresses your issue.  Like taking a warm bath, you will be soothed by the love for humanity in the answers Gibran provides.Before you speak, ask yourself who is about to speak for you and what do they want.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Transcend Human Subjectivity to Find Godlike Objectivity", "unixReviewTime": 980380800, "reviewTime": "01 25, 2001"}

{"reviewerID": "AFY0BT42DDYZV", "asin": "000100039X", "reviewerName": "Enamorato", "helpful": [5, 6], "reviewText": "These days, Kahlil Gibran's \"The Prophet\" often gets dismissed as \"hippie\" literature. Yet, this book had been a bestseller LONG before the 1960s. Originally published in 1923, it almost instantly became a hit and even did well through the Great Depression. Today, Gibran's claim to fame is being the third best-selling poet of our time, behind Shakespeare and Lao Tzu... and pretty much entirely based on sales of this book. When his publisher, Alfred Knopf was asked who the audience for the book was, he flippantly dismissed the question. \"It Must be a cult,\" he retorted.Yet there is no such cult. What's incredible is that there's absolutely no marketing hype behind the success of this book. Gibran himself is long gone. There is no political, religious, or commercial enterprise attached to his name bent on winning souls and/or profits. The Gibran estate has merely been licensing copies year after year in response to the demand - a demand fueled pretty much entirely by word-of-mouth and chance discovery. The fact is, the twenty-six poems in this book have a surprising and suprassing relevance, insight and compassion. Broken down into several topics (\"On Love\", \"On Work\", \"On Joy and Sorrow\", etc.) the book itself recounts the sermons of a fictional poet leaving behind the gift of knowledge before he leaves his homeland.I first found Gibran through a setting of his poem \"On Children\" by local Washington, D.C. singers Sweet Honey in the Rock on their album, \"Breaths.\"\"Your children are not your children.They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.They come through you but not from you,And though they are with you yet they belong not to you.\"At the time I was about to leave for college and eighteen years of living under my parent's roof had made me restless for autonomy. That poem eloquently expressed everything I was yearning to say to them in my hours of frustration and adolescent angst. It later proved to be a reference to turn to in times where I needed confidence to live an independent and fulfilling life, while still maintaining respect and compassion towards the parents who had raised me.I am not exaggerating when I say that the poems in this book have kept me grounded and sane throughout some of the most troubling times in my life. Our modern lives are ever hectic, stressful and busy - wrought with drama, frustration, depression, etc. The knowledge in these poems brings me back to a \"middle ground\" - there is a sage wisdom and clarity in the poems that has often been helpful for me in \"unwinding\" and coming back to earth. They bring me back to a place of clarity from whcih I can see my life from a wider perspective.Though Gibran himself was a Christian and despite the title and conceit of the book, this is not really a religious book. The insight in this book would be applicable to your life even if you are an atheist. What's more, the poetry is mostly imagistic. Do not expect the academic poetics of Gibran's contemporaries Eliot or Pound or even Frost. They are written with the aim of being accessible and immediate to the reader and rely mostly on clear metaphors and vivid imagery.Copies of \"The Prophet\" are not hard to come by. Perhaps check out the book's table of contexts either using Amazon's \"Search Inside\" feature or in your local bookstore and see if it addresses a problem or issue you are dealing with. That's a good a place as any to start with.

It works as prose poetry, in fact some of the best in English.  That is probably because Gibran somewhat mimics the poetry of the King James Version.  Some phrases and turns and images are brilliant.That said, what is the point of this book?  There are some nice things.  \"Is not religion all deeds and all reflections....  Who can separate his faith from his actions....  Who can spread his hours before him, saying, 'This is for God and this is for myself; This for my soul, and this other for my body?'\"Good point.  There are several such nuggets.  But, you can tell why the hippie-set loved this book: it is spirituality devoid of religion.  Namely, this book can make you feel all \"cosmic\" without all that pesky Christian morality.  That bit quoted above, it is followed by: \"He who wears his morality but as his best garment were better naked.\"Ah.  See what morals get you.  On crime and punishment, we get this \"It Takes a Village\" gem: \"And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.\"  See, crime is not the fault of the criminal, it is the fault of society.  \"The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked... Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured.\"  See, if you self-righteous rich folk didn't oppress the meek poor folk, they wouldn't have to commit crime.I wonder how the injured rape victim victimized her guilty rapist.Generally, the twin credos of \"The Prophet\" are (1) any path to God is the right path, and (2) if it feels good do it.(1)  Thus, the pluralistic relativism of lines like:\"Say not, 'I have found the truth,' but rather, 'I have found a truth.'  Say not, 'I have found the path of the soul.' Say rather, 'I have met the soul walking upon my path.'\"Forget that Jesus said, \"I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\"  (John 14:6, by the way.)  No, no, no.  Many willfully ignore that Jesus said such un-ecumenical things like this.  The hippie-Jesus thinks that there are many paths to God.  The whole \"one source, many wells\" philosophy.  Don't believe me?  Why do you think the folks at the Jesus Seminar blackballed this very verse (John 14:6)?  \"Our great, loving, hippie-Jesus believes that everyone comes to 'god' in his own way!  He would never say that!\"  Blackball.  (That last quotation wasn't an actual quote, by the way.)(2)  And, though the nature of the good and evil chapter is tempered by a sort-of \"love thy neighbor\" philosophy, it still defines \"good\" not as following Judaeo-Christian morals, or even a \"do unto others\" prescription, but \"You are good when you are one with yourself.\"If it feels good to you, do it.  Sure, Gibran later seems to warn against unbridled pleasure-seeking, \"Pleasure is a freedom-song, But it is not freedom.  It is the blossoming of your desires, But it is not their fruit.\"  Later,  however, such hedonism is considered a path (\"a truth\") to God:\"Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it were all, and they are judged and rebuked.  I would not judge or rebuke them.  I would have them seek.\"Thus the paradox of liberalism: the Prophet rebukes you for rebuking those hedons amongst you.  They are only on their path.  \"You are so wrong to tell them that they are wrong!\"  Ah, relativism!  The problem with unchecked hedonism (\"You are good when you are one with yourself,\" if you prefer) is that mankind always finds some inner reasoning to justify their evil actions.  Man always finds a way to make pleasure-at-any-cost, devoid of anything else, his god.I don't want to seem as if I am some stick in the mud, a prude, or an over-moralizing and self-righteous Christian.  Christian I am, and hedon I sometimes am.  I can get wheat from the chaff out of \"The Prophet.\"  There is much here that is good, and some of it is artfully written.  Some of Gibran's thoughts are even profound.  Still, there is much here that is bad, there is still some shuck on the ear, so to speak.  Sometimes you must take the wrong path which leads you to the right path, but there is just one right path, not several.  Gibran never seems to say that, and, since he was a Lebanese Christian, I find that sad.There is much here to lead you astray.I will not hold it against Gibran that \"The Prophet\" has inspired numerous imitations of lesser-poetic talent, sad purveyances of even fewer truths.  Yes, I am speaking of (amongst others) the trite, inane cacophonies of Paulo Coelho.And, for those reviewers and readers who think that \"The Prophet\" is the most poetic, most enlightening, most cosmically spiritual tome of all time: try reading the Psalms in the KJV with an open mind.(Yes.  I invented the word \"hedon.\"  \"Hedonist\" sounds like a philosophical school, as does \"epicurean.\"  The latter, too, is for an aesthete.  Let's say a hedon is a pleasure-seeker without the philosophy.  A hedon is an unsophisticate.  I probably made up that word too.)", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Unfortunately, the twin credos of \"The Prophet\" are any path to God is the right path and if it feels good do it", "unixReviewTime": 1388534400, "reviewTime": "01 1, 2014"}

He stresses the importance of \"letting go\" rather than \"taking charge,\" whether it's in relationship to your children, conflict situations, or the end of your life.I did not find it necessary, however, to fully agree with this Eastern outlook to appreciate the book, both for its poetic beauty and for inspiring thoughts.

A local seeress who knows him best asks him to share his wisdom so that it will endure for generations to come.So, he reveals his wisdom on love, birth, marriage, children, pain, talking, pleasure, death any so much more.It is a profound work, and here is his advice on marriage so you may judge for yourself:You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.But let there be spaces in your togetherness,And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.Love one another but make not a bond of love:Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone,Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.And stand together, yet not too near together:For the pillars of the temple stand apart,And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.Its not a little similar to theTao Te Ching: A New English Version (Perennial Classics)where a border guard recognises Lao Tzu, and asks him to share his wisdom as he goes into exile.

Having let things slip a little longer than intended I started reading it again, this time not trying to slam thru pages but rather reading one or two passages over lunch and seeing  the impact on me.  This time things flowed somewhat better for me.  The individual passages are nicely done covering aspects of life relevant to anyone.  While I don't always agree with Mr. Gibran philosophy for a subject, some are particularly moving; for me in particular his passage on Joy and Sorrow was borderline earth shaking with his explanation of the relationship of the two, describing to me why both can be so strong.Rating this one is extremely complex.  Some passages touch you and make you think about your life or what you have; others flow over you, whether discarded for future consumption is to be determined later.

The book does not stress the punishment of sins, but to bask in pleasure and not look back.

What can you say about a book that you believe to be one-of-a-kind? I have yet to find a book that I can compare it to.

Secondly and astonishingly the author portrays a story of a prophet speaking to his people, but I cannot be so shallow to think that I am reading a said story... I am not reading the said story--what is actually happening is that I am the listener and Kahlil Gibran is the prophet himself.  I strongly feel that if you the reader do not come away with this feeling yourself, you are probably reading some other book.I think what would do justice in this review is to explain some feelings you may get from a brief reading, in fact with that said, I can state with confidence that many readers will peruse only a few pages at a time because the content is overwhelming in its ability to provoke thought and feeling. You may feel at times that some all important life questions are being answered. You may feel regret  like I did,  I regret not having this book earlier in life to help me. I believe that a great many of you will feel amazed. It is truly amazing how such a short simple book can have such a profound impact on a person searching for answers to life's puzzles.There is a quote from the \"Urantia Book\" that is appropriate in closing this review. The quote helps to sum up one of the unexpected feelings I received from this incredible story, and that quote is.. \"The argumentative defense of any proposition is inversely proportional to the truth contained.\" ...and I give this quote because this book gives you the feeling that you are reading divine truth. I am a firm believer that if Kahlil Gibran is not a modern day prophet, no one is, and you too may come away with this belief because this is a story that really speaks to the heart of humanity.

Within each tiny chapter, profound moments can occur as we are given insight into unfamiliar territory, a place of thought not commonly existing in daily life but familiar to spiritual teachers.Kahlil Gibran magically explores the connection between sorrow and joy and how the deeper the sorrow you experience, the more joy you can contain. Talking becomes thoughts that can no longer \"dwell in the solitude of your heart\" so they \"live in your lips.\"As Almustafa waits for a ship to take him back to the isle of his birth, he climbs a hill outside the city walls and looks out to sea. When his \"ship arrives\" he is suddenly filled with regret, yet knows he must follow his destiny and return home.\"Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?\"The priests and priestesses ask him to remain in very poetic ways: \"Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.\"Almustafa only cries and doesn't seem to speak until a woman named Almitra appears. She is a woman who believed in him and he seems to have great fondness for her. We are not given any insight into their relationship, but his respect for her is unquestioned. She understands he must leave, but asks him to give the city his wisdom. She promises they will pass this wisdom down through the generations.While viewing pictures of Bsharri in Northern Lebanon, the mountains and the mist are almost a unique doorway into Kahlil Gibran's mind. He lived in a lush region where cascading falls, rugged cliffs and cedar trees influenced his art and writing.We can imagine his thoughts of home and this book was actually first imagined when he wrote a short story as a teenager. A Bostonian poet, Josephine Peabody, caught Gibran's attention at an art exhibition and she later referred to him as \"her young prophet.\"  She also wrote poems about Gibran's life and how she imagined his life in Bsharri. His life is woven into his writing in the most beautiful ways. He names his book for a woman he loves and his writing is infused with spiritual teachings and influences from his journey from Lebanon to New York.The story has an unassuming plot, but the lessons are eternal and the ending is surprisingly tender. I was left with a sense of longing that is still drifting along with me like the mists of Bsharri. The Prophet is not just a book to read, it is a spiritual journey to experience. It may take three or more days to complete the reading of this tiny book. I could only read about a third at a time because it is saturated in wisdom and many of the chapters want to be read and read again, until they are absorbed into your soul and written on your heart.\"But if you love and must needs have desires,let these be your desires:To melt and be like a running brook thatsings its melody to the night.\" ~Kahlil Gibran~The Rebecca Review", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "The Invisible Revealed", "unixReviewTime": 1117411200, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2005"}

Everybody I knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people. A folk/ talking blues singer of that era (I forget who) referred to this book in a lyric:\"...a copy of Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' with all the significant passages highlighted--the whole damn BOOK was highlited...\"In truth, the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults. It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how \"relevant\" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song \"Consider Me Gone\" for consideration:\"To search for perfectionIs all very wellBut to wait for HeavenIs to live here in Hell\"", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Deceptively pseudo-scriptural", "unixReviewTime": 1022025600, "reviewTime": "05 22, 2002"}

But that should not take away from the fact that there are important life lessons in these works that are as relevant today as they were when they were written, as Mr Gibran's words, I believe, fall firmly within that description.Enjoy.....Editing for Kindle: 4 out 5Reading Enjoyment: 5 out of 5Plot:Overall Rating: 5 out of 5Chapters:Page length: 133", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Words of Wisdom for Everyone", "unixReviewTime": 1395792000, "reviewTime": "03 26, 2014"}

(I'm positive it was just after I turned 16 because I have memories connected to reading it in my room with an open window and hearing a Friday night football game in the distance from the high school...and not wanting to go to another football game because I had to free my friend from the outside port-a-potty after my other friend thought she was being funny and held the door closed when the other girl was going to come out....and naturally my claustrophobic friend started screaming and freaking out. She did the same thing I would do.Anyone of any age can enjoy this book,I just wish I had a copy around so I could refresh my memory and do a more detailed review. Of course I'm sure I would have read it more than the one time I read it, if I did have the same copy I had when I was a teenager. I always read books I really like more than one time.This book and The Little Prince by Saint Exupery;Siddhartha,Demian and Steppenwolf (all by Herman Hesse) are books I read at the same time period and that I also don't have anymore,either because I gave my copy to someone;or,had bought another copy for myself and also gave that copy away, or,they just went the way of all things,as things go...in time (and my 16th birthday was quite awhile ago...sigh.... 16 has also \"gone the way of all things\"....but not completely!)Anyone who likes The Prophet (or any of the other titles I mentioned) can consider themselves lucky if they have a friend who has read,or who has one of these books on their bookshelves;or who has a friend that would also appreciate this type of literature.

Walker \"Home School Book Review\"", "helpful": [11, 40], "reviewText": "\"The Prophet\" is Almustafa, called \"the chosen and the beloved,\" who has lived twelve years in the foreign city of Orphalese, and is now waiting for the ship that is to come and take him back to the isle of his birth.  Just as the ship appears, all the men and women of the community, including the elders of the city and the priests and priestesses, come to say farewell.  They ask him to stay, but he refuses.  Then the local seeress named Almitra addresses him as \"Prophet of God\" and asks him to speak to them of love and then marriage.  After this, others ask him to speak of various subjects, some lofty such as children, giving, and joy and sorrow, and others more mundane, such as eating and drinking, work, houses, and buying and selling.  There are in fact a total of 26 short chapters in which \"the Prophet\" holds forth before he takes his leave.  Kahlil Gibran was born Gubran Khalil Gibran to a Maronite Catholic family in the historic town of Bsharri in modern-day Lebanon, then part of the Ottoman Empire. His mother Kamila was the daughter of a priest.  When his father was imprisoned for embezzlement, Kamila decided to follow her brother to the United States, settling in the South End of Boston, MA, then the second largest Lebanese-American community in the United States. Due to a mistake at school, he was registered as Kahlil.As a young man Gibran studied art and began a literary career.  His first book for the Alfred A. Knopf publishing company, was The Madman in 1918, a slim volume of aphorisms and parables written in a Biblical-like cadence somewhere between poetry and prose.  The Prophet is said to be an early example of \"inspirational fiction\" consisting of a series of philosophical essays written in poetic English prose.  The book became especially popular during the 1960s with the American counterculture and New Age movements.  Much of Gibran's writings seems based on Christianity, but his mysticism reveals a convergence of several other influences as well, including Islam, Sufism, Hinduism, and theosophy.  To illustrate the relativistic nature of Gibran's theology, \"the Prophet\" says, \"Say not, `I have found the truth,' but rather, `I have found a truth.'\"  Jesus said, \"You shall know THE truth\" (John 8:32), and, \"I am the way, THE truth, and the life\" (John 14:6).  Gibran followed The Prophet with The Garden of The Prophet, which narrates Almustafa's discussions with nine disciples following his return after an intervening absence and was published posthumously in 1933.  Gibran had died in New York City, NY, on April 10, 1931; the cause was determined to be cirrhosis of the liver and tuberculosis.I would never have gone out and purchased this book myself.  However, I have heard of it all my life.  It is supposed to be a classic and a \"spiritual masterpiece,\" so when I found it in my father's library after his death, I decided to keep it and read it.  My reaction is, \"Ugh.\"  As far as I am concerned, it is mostly pantheistic nonsense.  Someone might say, \"It's all Greek to me,\" but since I took two years of Greek in college, if it were \"all Greek\" I might be able to make some sense of it.  I'll just say it's all gobblety-gook to me.  The Chicago Post said that The Prophet \"brings to one's ears the majestic rhythm of Ecclesiastes.\"  Ecclesiastes I can understand; The Prophet I do not!  This doesn't mean that there's nothing good in it.  The ravings of a lunatic sometimes contain a kernel of truth.  Even a broken clock is right twice a day.  However, there is nothing of value that might be gained from The Prophet which can't be learned a whole lot better by simply reading the Bible.  Besides, ten of the twelve full-page drawings by the author are rather immodest and consist solely of nude figures.  Of course, this is not surprising when you read what \"the Prophet\" says about clothes.  \"Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.  And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.  Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment.\"  Oh, by the way, even as simply \"poetry\" it just doesn't do anything for me.

B Collins Jr.", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Historic fiction requires exceptional skills to capture character as well as time and place. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie certainly excels in this regard, reminding me of the skills of Hilary Mantel. The plight of a Crimean War surgeon comes alive in all its gore and misery and insanity. The tale is told through the eyes of the surgeon's brother-in-law, his off and on boyfriend and photographic assistant, and Myrtle, an orphan informally adopted by the family and mother of his children. The Crimean War offers a backdrop of incompetent diplomatic and military leadership dissolving into a nightmare of gore, horror, disease, dysentery, crime, and cruelty. Bainbridge captures the disorganized international disaster with many horrible bloody details, having her characters do the best they can to survive the catastrophe. Yet, Bainbridge captures more than just history, time, place, and character for her writing is poetic and her attention to detail is superb. Early in the novel, Myrtle cleans the dog hair off of a tiger skin rug and as she pulls the white dog hairs from the brush, they float like dandelion seed up the wind-draft of the staircase and nestle on the chandelier. It is such details that make the book beautiful and horrible at the same time. The pace of the book is excellent and she moves the reader from critical chapter to chapter in the lives of the main characters. I almost think she wrote too little in this book. I would have loved to have the book twice as long. The character of Pompey Jones, the bisexual street urchin, is fascinating and I wish Bainbridge had written a novel just for this self-aware, self-assured, character to follow Master Georgie. Bainbridge actually focuses much of the novel on the character of Myrtle, and we learn as much about her amazing strength of character as we do about that of her sometime lover George Hardy. Myrtle and Pompey are both orphans, street wise, highly intelligent, and are recognized for their strengths by the Hardy family.George Hardy is never fully explained and made visible to the viewer for his motives are somewhat hidden. As a homosexual or bisexual physician from an upper class home, it appears that his service in the Crimean is somewhat of a penance, a sacrifice, for his sexuality. He strives to be the perfect son to his father, mother, and siblings, yet the secret of his sexuality means that a critical part of him must be hidden from his family. George Hardy appears to sacrifice himself during the Crimean War due to his sexual orientation over which he has no control. In some ways this is also a study of gay guilt in the Victorian period and the mechanisms and strategies undertaken to atone for an unacceptable sexual orientation. George is contrasted with Pompey who seems much more at home with his bisexuality, recognizing it as more a part of himself and as an asset by which he can manipulate both men and women. The narrative of war is haunting, reminding me of the outstanding novels of Pat Barker about World War I. We read of handsome shirtless soldiers dying from eating unwashed cherries or horses bleeding to death while standing with bullet holes through their body. It is the third narrator, Dr. Potter, George's brother-in-law that offers unique looks at all the other characters. Potter is intellectual and foolish at the same time. He lacks practicality but his power of observation is evident. Overall the book is excellent, a post-modern masterpiece, telling a complex tale from multiple points of view but never giving the `definitive' story behind the story.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "An historic novel of personal proportions", "unixReviewTime": 1281225600, "reviewTime": "08 8, 2010"}

Through the course of the novel the idea of an image taken is made increasingly more complex as is the mystery of George who is most often portrayed idealistically as a man of high knowledge and wisdom. Through the carefully written language of the narrative, there are surprisingly human incidents and facts revealed that are startlingly human. These are placed in the frame of the historical context leading to the war between England and Russia. The gruesome events of the war that follow strip each of the three characters of their pretence and leaves them yearning for the image of their lost ideal, Master George.

I thought it nonsense that an illiterate girl in nineteenth century Liverpool could never write such exquisite prose as evidenced in  this novel, and that this was a case of the authorial voice being too  strong.  As it happened, I couldn't have been more wrong.  This novel is  narrated by the close acquaintances of 'Master Georgie' (although some are  closer than others), starting with the illiterate Myrtle.  Immediately we  are drawn into the action, as this sequence of a photograph being taken  will resound throughout the novel.  'Master Georgie' is incredibly subtle,  and it is only by looking back over it that you begin to appreciate that  this is the most suitable of beginnings.  Here is where Myrtle begins on  her road to becoming a lady.  And what an unsavory road it is, as Myrtle's  help is initially required to cover up the manner in which George Hardy's  father has died, and leads to the bloody battlefields of the Crimea.  Also  assisting with the cover-up is the duck-boy and street urchin, Pompey Jones  and the pompous Dr. Potter, whose narrations are by far the best.  George  Hardy himself is an ambiguous figure, seen only through the eyes of others.  It may be a fault that we never really get to know him.  This is a novel  of cameras, carnality, and carnage.  The dreadful shadow of history is cast  upon it, with the famous charge of the Light Brigade lightly alluded to.  One almost expects to run into a lady with a lamp at every corner, but  fortunately, Bainbridge avoids this excess.  She takes events frozen in  time, such as the front cover's photograph, and brings them into life and  death, and maybe even beyond.  The camera never lies... Or does it?  Bainbridge fervently burrows into the psyche of characters, enabling them  to bring about apparitions vivid enough to be captured by film.  In my  mind's eye, I see Bainbridge pouring over ancient photographs from the  Crimea, trying to put names to faces and to see if she could walk around in  their bloody shoes.  She succeeds.  If I'd have been on 1998's Booker  panel, I know I would have placed Bainbridge before McEwan.  And the reason  wouldn't have the desire to give her a consolatory, but demeaning, long  service award.

This would be wrong. Master Georgie is no safe tale of country house manners, of marriages imagined by confined, embroidering young women. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie is anything but a tale of such saccharine gentility.Master Georgie is a surgeon and photographer, and the book is cast in six plates - photographic plates, not chapters. Death figures throughout. From start to finish morbidity crashes into the lives of the book's characters. We begin with Mr Moody, dead in a brothel bed, his host of minutes before in shock. Later we move to the Crimean War, where the carnage is graphic, extensive and apparently random. And even then individuals find their own personal ways of adding insult and injury to the suffering.The book uses multiple points of view. We see things Master Georgie's way. Myrtle, an orphan he takes in, adds her perspective. The fussy geologist, Dr Potter, imprints his own version of reality. And still there are less than explained undercurrents, undeclared motives which affect them all. Thus, overall, Master Georgie is a complex and ambitious novel. Though it is set in a major war, the backdrop is never allowed to dominate. The characters experience the consequences of conflict and register their reactions, but we are never led by the nose trough the history or the geography of the setting.But we also never really get to know these people. Myrtle, perhaps, has the strongest presence. She has a slightly jaundiced, certainly pragmatic approach to life. But even she finds the privations of wartime tough. Why the characters of Master Georgie are all so keen to offer themselves as support for the war effort is an aspect of the book that never fully revealed itself. And ultimately this was my criticism of Beryl Bainbridge's book. While the overall experience was both rewarding and not a little shocking, I found there was insufficient delineation between the characters and their differing motives. The beauty of the prose, however, more than made up for any shortcoming. The language created the mixed world of mid-nineteenth century politeness and juxtaposed this with the visceral vulgarities of soldiering and the general struggle of life. This rendered Master Georgie a complex, moving and quite beautiful book.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Complex, moving, finely crafted", "unixReviewTime": 1202083200, "reviewTime": "02 4, 2008"}

Each chapter in this short (190 pages) novel takes its title from a  picture illustrating its contents.

It's ironic how attibutes like these can possibly be descriptions of a good writer. It is these very faults that bring about the ruin of MASTER GEORGIE.The novel spans the years 1846-1854. Master Georgie, or George Hardy,  is the young son of a rich Liverpool merchant. He is a shadow figure in the sense that he never takes over the narration of the story. That is left up to three other characters. One of these is Myrtle, an orphan who was taken in by the Hardys as a child and is deeply in love with George. She follows him in his restless wanderings of Liverpool. One night, in a sordid episode they find George's father dead in the bed of a prostitute. Along with another character who does narration, Pompey Jones (a street hustler), they are able to cover up the scandal that would have hurt and tarnished his family. The three characters are bonded by this secret for the rest of their lives, and as the novel progresses this deepens into love, both sexual and spiritually. It becomes a love triangle which causes a lot of pain and little satisfaction. The last voice that enters into the picture is  the eccentric Dr. Potter who has a hankering for George's sister. Nobody likes the guy because instead of confronting life, he dwells instead in books, mainly the classical writers of Rome and Greece. When you start a conversation with him, he begins quoting from an author instead of communicating sense to you. Towards the latter part of the book, all the characters become involved in the Crimean War. Or actually George becomes involved in the war and wherever he is it sucks the others with him. Just like all wars, this one changes the future of not just the combatants but also of the bystanders.The parts of the book set in Liverpool are quite good and interesting. They seem to be written with more passion and personal knowledge than the war scenes. The books problem lies in the deadpan writing. It's like watching the stand up comedy of Steven Wright, where a monotone voice is supposed to make you laugh by its very absence of emotion. It's the same thing here. We are supposed to feel horror and love through understatement when neither of these emotions are capable of understatement. The closer I got to the end, the more bored I got.

Her stories rarely have definitive separations between what actually happened, and what might have happened to the characters she creates. The Crimean War is the setting this time, and while historically noteworthy is not as familiar as some of her other subjects, like The Titanic, or the doomed Scott Expedition to the South Pole. What is consistent is her ability to jump about through time periods without ever losing credibility. Each of her books reads as if a unique pen is behind each one. The hand of course is the same, however the moods created are remarkably singular.The character that is the book's title is a complex human study, or if you prefer, a very intricate person but occupied with a mind and personality as muddled, as it is diverse. A grotesque death scene is the entrance for one of the narrator's of the book, an individual that would have lived as a street urchin but for chance, and an ambiguous bit of goodwill. A second street personality with many more wiles and flexible conduct also becomes a member of Master Georgie's entourage. This second narrator has a unique view of events, as he is close when Master Georgie requires, for the latter's sexuality is repressed at best. These are just two people who eventually head to the middle of The Crimean War, and the question that keeps shadowing the reader is why?Escape from the latter half of 19th century London is an easy answer for George, but what of the others? Taking a trip toward an impending war as George's groupies is one matter, staying in the midst of a war is much more puzzling. This is one of the most difficult of Ms. Bainbridge's books that I have read. Previous works have often served as a metaphor for the time they occupy, or the closing act in a World that is about to undergo great disruptive change. This work is not as apparently decisive.One characteristic is consistent, and that is her master's grasp of language. A lapful of cherries that serve as a metaphor will haunt a reader for some time. Her images of the dead and dying are less grotesquely graphic than most writers portray, but are far more disturbing than other wartime battles. This may not be the best of her work if it is the first of hers you experience, however if you can successfully decipher this one, that are several others that are much more comfortable to read.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Very Dark Historical Fiction", "unixReviewTime": 996019200, "reviewTime": "07 25, 2001"}

Part of the Bible is to addressed to the Jews, Gentiles and to the Church which consititute the three classes. Mr. Larkin gives his explanation of the ages and dispensations. He continues on to explain the age of the earth that in Gen 1:3-31 was the restoration of the earth to its original condition before it was made \"formless and void\" and submerged in water and darkness and how there is millenniums of time that science may require for the formation of the earth as a planet.

Grania is taught to read with &quot;The Sunday Book,&quot; a precious gift from her grandmother that becomes a metaphor for life's struggles and complications as Grania emerges from childhood, attends school, and meets &quot;Chim,&quot; a hearing man who loves her stillness. Just married, Grania must return home to wait while Jim goes to war as a stretcher bearer.Once again, WWI emerges as incredibly pointless and bloody, as men are thrown into the confusion of the European front. Jim experiences the war as a haze of brutal sound.

Meanwhile at home, a beloved friend from Grania's childhood who became her sister's husband returns home, mute from a horror no one can imagine.

My enjoyment of these 99 pages is what makes this a three star book despite the fact I grew too bored to finish somewhere in the middle of part three.  Here is why:Part one is about a child named Grania growing up in Canada in the late 1800's.  A bout with scarlet fever at the age of 5 has rendered her permanently deaf.  Thankfully, Grania has an understanding family, especially her grandmother, and with their patience, she learns to lip read.  I know from my own experience, lip reading is not an easy task and this book shows us just how difficult it is.  Grania struggles to see words, understand words, and even feel words.  Readers will feel her frustration, her fears, and her shame at times.  When she begins school, we see how the deaf are treated by the hearing people with less than kind hearts.  The teacher does not want to take time out of her already busy day to ensure Grania understands what is going on.  The children like to laugh at her and play games that humilate her.  Most upsetting of all is the ignorant assumption that deaf means dumb.  When Grania is sent to a deaf school to learn lip reading and sign language, we see another world.  It is a world of silence, yet friendships build and minds expand.Part two is about an adult Grania who falls in love with a hearing man named Jim.  Jim is a nice fellow, but he does not hold my interest.  I found his conversations with Grania dull and their romance a bit sappy.  My mind began to wander.Part three follows Jim as he enters World War One and the fighting he experiences or sees.  This created a problem for me, as I said earlier, Jim just didn't hold my interest.Part one seemed a novel all of its own.  The style changed after that.

Grania has been deaf since the age of five, and Itani opens her inner world to the reader, using Grania's voice to tell the story and gracefully conveying her deafness as part of her selfhood, not as a handicap.  Using short sentences of twelve to fifteen words when Grania is a young child trying to figure out her world, Itani begins the story in a simple subject-verb-object pattern, using no complicated clauses or involved syntax, which Grania herself would be incapable of using.  When Grania becomes fluent in sign language and lip-reading, the sentence structure becomes more complex.  By the time she marries Jim, a hearing man, sentences and syntax are fully developed, and Grania's ability to recognize ambiguity, to see relationships between events, and to respond fully to a hearing world are obvious in her &quot;voice.&quot;The point of view alternates between Grania and Jim, once Jim goes off to war, and important themes--war and peace, life and death, love and friendship, and strength and dependence--weave and develop throughout their contrasting worlds, Grania at home and Jim at the front in Belgium.  Itani develops these age-old themes in new ways, sensitively incorporating them with the imagery of sounds and silence, sight and shadows, action and inaction, images we have come to associate with the life Grania and Jim share.  In Jim's traumatic world, sound becomes overwhelming:  pounding guns, explosions, screams of agony from wounded soldiers.  As a result of his life with Grania, however, he is also acutely sensitive to what he sees, discovering, ironically, that it is the hands of the dead and dying that communicate most vividly because they &quot;revealed the final argument: clenched in anger, relaxed in acquiescence, seized in a posture of surprise or forgiveness.&quot;The subordinate characters further flesh out the themes.  The friendship and interdependence of Jim and Irish, his best friend parallel the love and support Grania has received from her sister, her remarkable grandmother, and her deaf friends.  Grania gains strength through them and is able to give support and strength to others when they need her, just as Jim gains strength from his relationship with Irish and continues to rescue the wounded and dying.  As the reader comes to know Grania and Jim and the love they feel for each other, Grania's silent but active world becomes more and more understandable to the reader.  Ultimately, the reader has to agree with Grania when she declares, ironically, &quot;Sound is always more important to the hearing.&quot;  Mary Whipple", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Graceful and original treatment of man's oldest themes.", "unixReviewTime": 1064361600, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2003"}

It's very quiet--too quiet.  As we try to inhabit the life and mind of Grania, deaf since the age of five from scarlet fever, we imagine what it would be like not to know when someone is approaching from behind, or to know when the speaker has changed in a conversation.  This book was just too slow-paced for me and the characters too one-dimensional.  Grania and her hearing husband Jim seem to be without fault.  More complex is Grania's sister Tress, who struggles with her emotions when her husband comes back from WWI disfigured and dysfunctional.  Another interesting character is their mother, who postpones sending Grania to a school for the deaf as long as possible, while she battles her guilt over Grania's hearing loss and seeks a cure via specialists and spiritual quests.  However, the author doesn't fully explore the inner conflicts of Tress or her mother, and we are left with a love story between two very nice people.  Jim's story is more disturbing than Grania's, actually, as he becomes a stretcher bearer during the war and sees both friends and patients blown up inches away from him on a regular basis.  His sections of the book are very moving reminders that the lives lost in wars are not just statistics.

The setting is initially in Ontario, Canada in the late 1800's and then eventually alternating between Ontario and the European theater of World War I.I must admit I had some difficultly getting into this work, but I persevered and I'm glad I did, because this book is truly a magnificent read. Once committed, I could barely stand to put the book down.As with all great books, what makes this book special, is the quality of the writing.

You learn things about deafness, quietness and darkness that you never really noticed before;  you begin to appreciate what people without hearing have to endure to get through an hour, a day or a lifetime. There were a couple of occasions in this book where I was taken aback with a new revelation regarding deafness; where I would just let this book slip to my lap and think about what I'd just read.There are parts in this book that are not for the faint of heart; some of the description of the trench warfare in France and Belgium are very graphic and disturbing. (but, most likely, accurate)All in all, a story that is quietly beautiful and at the same time beautifully sad. Really, one of my favorite books.

And it was an intriguing one to contrast her silent world with the cacophony of the western front in World War I. The novel that results contains interesting characters and effective passages, but it is too diffuse to really work.Grania O'Neill -- the name is an anglicization of the Irish for \"love\" -- loses her hearing at the age of five as a result of scarlet fever. She wakens to a world shaped and contained by words, but where language is deceptive and words have to be agonizingly relearned. She has an ally in her grandmother Mamo; the relationship between the two is the most lovely thing in the book. But I found the early chapters repetitive and could never enter fully into Grania's world. I was more interested in the relatively brief section dealing with her time at a special boarding school and the battle between the two theories of education for the deaf: sign language and the oral method.As a young adult, Grania falls in love and marries. But it is 1915, and her husband Jim goes off to war as a medical orderly. The unusual perspective makes some of the war writing quite powerful, occasionally approaching the intensity of classics such as Sebastian Faulks'BIRDSONG. And the scenes back in Canada show something even less often written about, a picture of wartime life on the home front. But the fact remains that there is an ocean between Grania and Jim, and their parallel stories barely connect. Still, a few touching episodes do manage to bridge the gap, as when one of their friends returns wounded and mute, and Grania teaches him once more to talk.This is a book that needed to dwell in language and sound, and above all in silence. It calls for an almost abstract style that can handle ideas and sensations rather than events -- poetry rather than prose. The steady narrative that Itani offers contains much that will interest and even move its readers, but for this reader at least the most exciting promises are lost.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Sign Language", "unixReviewTime": 1221264000, "reviewTime": "09 13, 2008"}

{"reviewerID": "AJDYDG7YZY9QL", "asin": "0002005395", "reviewerName": "Stephen A. Haines", "helpful": [8, 8], "reviewText": "The true test of an author is the ability to portray the mind of someone else.  Recently, that ability has been stretched by writers who describe the \"abnormal\".  The young, autistic Christopher in \"Curious Incident\" is the prime example.  Frances Itani takes us into a different world, that of the deaf.  It's a world of endless confusion.  There are sounds, so easy to the hearing, but meaningless to the deaf.  We think speech is the only important sound, but talk is hurried, undirected, and indistinct.  Nature produces her own sounds which we use in speech, but for which there's no meaning to the deaf.  Through Grania O'Brien's early life, Itani strives to introduce us to that world.  Does she succeed?Grania, who would have been \"Grainne\" in her ancestral Ireland, lives in small-town Ontario as the story opens.  Deafened by scarlet fever [remember that?], she's coached by Mamo, her grandmother.  Blessed with a quick eye for lip-reading, Grania is given a book with words displayed as rope.  The rope, of course, becomes highly symbolic as the book progresses, but Grania begins to equate the shapes with meaning.  Mamo strains to have the girl equate printed words with proper sounds.  It's important that Grania \"blend in\" with the rest of the community.  With her parents running a hotel, Grania's only other tie is with her sister Tress, with whom she develops a secret sign language.All of Mamo's dedicated effort, nor trips to sacred shrines, can't force the pace.  Grania is to leave home for a \"Deaf School\".  Itani portrays the school as staffed with immensely caring ladies.  No Dickens intrudes with harsh discipline or abuse, but the school draws children from across the Province.  All the children remain in school until the summer holidays.  Sign language is discouraged for those who can speak - dividing the children, some of whom are mute.  Itani passes rapidly over Grania's progress in the school.  The deaf girl, however, manages to shed some of her fear of the dark - a long-held terror.Meeting a young aide in a hospital after leaving the school, Grania's life takes a new turn.  The courtship is but a moment in the story - the wedding description not even related until much later in the book.  Instead, the Kaiser rudely intrudes on their lives with the invasion of Belgium.  Itani carefully rejects any political discussion in the narrative.  King and Country [Britain, not Canada] are under threat and Jim must sign up.  There's no family discussion, no question of how Irish immigrants in a far land should react - Jim crosses the Atlantic.  There's a training stint, then Jim finds himself in the thick of battle.  When time and circumstances permit, letters are scribbled in muddy trenches.  Sometimes Grania's reach Jim, but delays in the exchanges make communication a flimsy thread.Itani makes a splendid effort to depict the impact of the Great War.  Confronted as we are today by daily images of conflict, Itani still manages to impart a special sense of horror at events.  The years pass with Jim, a stretcher-bearer, braving the bombardments and fusillades of machine-gun fire, without being able to fight back.  He carries wounded, tends their injuries, dodges fire and grows increasingly introspective.  Never once, does he question the worth of the conflict.  At home in Desoronto, Grania watches the causality lists, the statistics of insanity, lengthen while she worries.  Soldier's wives need more visibility and Itani's effort is commendable.This book cries out for a sequel.  Grania's life hardly ends with the Armistice.  With the end of the War, her deafness remains, the family is almost intact and a future must unroll.  Itani has built a unique scenario with skillful prose.  You will not find it easy to put this book down as you read.  However, when you do finish, you will find the conclusion abrupt.  Nothing is lost by that finale, but there might be much gained by going on.

It is interesting to me that many of the reviews focus on his chapter on Milk.  I didn't take that much from that chapter, but simply that the verdict isn't really out on Milk.  I think he would have done better to address the question of raw or pasteurized--another big subject of debate.  But, that logically must come from the belief first that milk is good for you and I didn't really feel that he made a decisive decision about it though he leaned more towards milk than away from it.There were several things I enjoyed about this book.  I enjoyed learning a lot of nutritional history--like the history of vitamins and how different things in our food (like canola oil) were developed.  There were also interesting chapters about various vitamins.  I now finally understand why there are vitamins B6 and B12, but not B7 and B8 (they were originally named and then discarded because people realized they had no nutritional value).  There was a very interesting (to me) chapter about detox diets and the lack of scientific evidence that they do any good.  In fact, there is no evidence that there are health benefits to them.But, the reason I haven't given it 4 or 5 stars, is that the author leans heavily towards the opinion that chemicals in our food is just fine.  Even given his scientific evidence, I am not fully persuaded.  Many of the things he talked about haven't been around for years, so we don't know their long term effects.  It was just this year that several reports were published stating that artificial sweeteners are digested the same as regular sugar and do not contribute to weightloss.  Which, by the way, I was very surprised that he didn't talk about Splenda at all but he did talk about other artificial sweeteners.

It's what you know for sure that just ain't so.\"  If (some of) the reviews for this book are any indication, Dr. Joe was right: scientific scrutiny is unlikely to change anyone's mind.  People continue to smoke, people continue to eat mostly red meat, etc.  Those people who eat red meat and smoke are often willing to admit they are participating in unhealthy behaviour.  So much more, then, is it difficult or impossible to convince people through the scientific literature that their preconceived notions are not correct when the topic is not something for which literally billions of people have served as experimental subjects (through their normal activities).  That is an observation that is mostly independent of the book's qualities as prose and entertainment, but it does identify the point from which this book starts.In a series of bite-sized chapters (3-5 pages), Schwarcz takes us through some of the topics he's encountered and researched in his role as a science commentator over the last 30 (?) years.  As such, I would suggest that the topics are a little skewed to the supplements side - there are many chapters devoted to particular dietary supplements with supposedly miraculous effects (to cure cancer, lose weight, etc.).  These claims are usually laughably easy to dismiss because the \"evidence\" of their efficacy is non-existent.  The book is much more interesting when he tackles issues of pesticides, teflon, and artificial sweeteners.  Generally, the scientific literature shows that the amounts of these items in an average diet are so small as to be non-issues.  Sure, they cause cancer - in amounts millions of times as large as humans take in.  And these amounts are far less than the naturally occurring carcinogens that we are exposed to automatically because we breath and eat food.  This leads to the primary thesis of the book, with which no nutritional expert could argue: eat a good balanced diet that emphasizes vegetables, fruit, and whole grains.This thesis is proven again and again throughout the book, and the primary problem of this book is its repetative nature.  In trying to keep each chapter reasonably autonomous, and because the conclusions are virtually the same each time, the author cannot possibly make the book entertaining for long reading times.  It's more of a \"pick up, read a bit, put down for a couple days\" kind of book.Other reviewers have objected to the lack of footnotes.  This is a valid criticism; I suppose it was a conscious choice on the author's and editor's parts (for ease of readability).  Certainly I would have prefered if the studies he cites were more clearly referenced.  (Rise and Fall of the Third Reich had thousands of references, so it's insulting to think that the reader would pass on buying the book simply because they are in there, especially as this book's raison d'etre is to bring to the public the objective scientific conclusions on the nutritional questions raised in the book).  I would add the criticism that two hot-button nutritional issues are not dealt with.  (1) Bisphenol-A, a monomer used in polycarbonate synthesis, has been banned by Health Canada and others, but ruled safe (in the amounts present in polycarbonate drinking and storage vessels) by the FDA.  Based on the number of articles I see (in newspapers and even the American Chemical Society's magazine), this chemical is perfectly positioned for the Dr. Joe treatment, and I find it curious that it is omitted.  (2) Perhaps because this movement has only gained real traction since the book was written it was not included, but the \"eat local\" mantra is in conflict with the \"eat lots of variety\" mantra espoused by nutritionists and featured prominently in the book.  If you live in a breadbasket (e.g. California), you can have a widely varied diet throughout the year.  If you live in a northern clime (e.g. northern Minnesota, most of Canada), you will not have access to locally grown fresh fruit and veggies for most of the year.  Eating as Dr. Schwarcz suggests would leave you with an enormous carbon footprint due to the transportation and refrigeration costs of moving the food from southern locations.It is also curious that Dr. Joe never mentions the placebo effect.  Some remedies are effective because the patient thinks they will be effective.  Sure, double-blind studies take this into account (people receiving the placebo and the test compound are both going to benefit from the placebo effect, so any additional effect in the test group will be due to the efficacy of the test compound), but anecdotal \"evidence\" is easy to accumulate by charletons, and these testamonials can certainly be true!  If you're one of the lucky ones whose cancer goes into remission at the same time as you started drinking three litres of acai juice a day, you will certainly \"know\" that the acai juice caused the remission.  So it's my unfortunate conclusion that Dr. Joe is singing to the choir with this book - those with a scientific/statistical background will be convinced, but we were convinced anyways.  Those who are the statistical outliers will still be convinced of their positions, and the charletans will continue to make money off of them.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Some neat tidbits, but it's somewhat repetative and unfortunately it's unlikely to change anyone's mind", "unixReviewTime": 1257120000, "reviewTime": "11 2, 2009"}

Judging by this book I'm thinking he should stick to chemistry.I'm not saying that Schwarcz's dietary recommendations are bad. After you take away the discussions of chemical terms and processes you end up with the same sort of recommendations you've been hearing about for decades: Eat mostly foods based on vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and low-fat dairy, and don't overeat. Hey, is there ANY nutrition book out there that recommends eating mostly meat, fat, and sugar, and overeating?I majored in biology at college, so I thought that a chemistry-focused discussion of nutrition would be interesting. I was wrong. I can't really fault Schwarcz for that, because his book makes it clear that it will get into some chemistry, and many of the chemicals in foods have long, hard to pronounce names. But the subtitle to the book led me to believe that the chemistry discussion would be enlivened by learning about \"the myths, misconceptions, and truths about the foods we eat.\" Again I was wrong, and this time I can fault Schwarcz. Schwarcz ends up recommending the same type of whole-food, unprocessed diet as any mainstream diet book, so I wonder just which myths and misconceptions he thinks he is addressing? He recommends that meat should be \"an occasional treat,\" and even then the portion size \"should cover a small portion of the plate.\" Those people who still believe in the \"myth\" that humans need to eat lots of meat would sooner barbecue Schwarcz's book than read it. Regarding other myths and misconceptions, Schwarcz is covering old, well-trod ground. I suppose this book might be helpful to someone who has had his head in the nutritional sands for the past two decades.I can't forgive the chapter on milk. His discussion of calcium and osteoporosis is superficial at best. He doesn't address any of the major risk factors for osteoporosis, nor does he discuss the chemical processes underlying them, nor effective countermeasures. He doesn't offer a single study demonstrating that consuming dairy lowers the incidence of bone fractures, which seems strange considering that this is the dairy industry's number one claim to fame. Schwarcz does point to two studies which contradict his claim that milk is good for bones, but he blatantly dismisses them. One study shows that \"Asians have a lower incidence of osteoporosis than Westerners even though they consume less dairy.\" Schwarcz responds by saying, \"True enough, but they also have a very different overall diet and lifestyle.\" He leaves it at that, and he doesn't bother to say what parts of the \"very different diet and lifestyle\" are healthier! He then mentions the comprehensive Nurses' Health Study \"which found that nurses who drank two or more glasses of milk a day actually broke more bones and had a higher risk of hip fractures.\" Schwarcz responds by subscribing to a hypothesis that the nurses who drank more milk were the ones who had the weakest bones to begin with! I say hypothesis because he has no evidence for it. To make things worse, Schwarcz goes out of his way to describe anyone who \"criticizes\" milk consumption as part of the \"antimilk lobby,\" driven more by an irrational agenda than any objective analysis of the evidence. I eat moderate amounts of dairy (for taste, not health), and I'm not part of any antimilk lobby, but does that mean I must believe that dairy foods are good for my bones? Schwarcz says that when we \"look at the totality of the evidence, an overwhelming number of studies show that bone strength improves with calcium intake, and dairy products offer the best source of calcium.\" Schwarcz is linking dairy to calcium to bone strength, which in effect means he is suggesting that dairy is good for bones. But again, he doesn't offer even one study which gives any evidence for this claim, and instead shows us two studies which contradict it. Furthermore, Schwarcz dismisses \"antimilk\" arguments that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning. He's missing the entire point: the objective and telling observation that all adult animals on earth thrive without milk. Schwarcz would have us believe as scientific gospel that human adults, for special reasons he never explains, need milk to thrive and prevent bone fractures (except, of course, for those Asian human adults, who have very different diets and lifestyles!).This is the model of clear, rational, scientific thinking we're supposed to follow, as Publishers Weekly says, that \"leaves readers with a rational framework for evaluating the complex nature of foods and how they affect health.\"? I'd say it's a great example of a cloudy, irrational, and incomplete framework. In the end, the best that Schwarcz can do is tell us that milk \"is not a poison,\" as some fringe members of PETA might say.In conclusion, Schwarcz did not bust any new myths or misconceptions and his recommendations are consistent with mainstream recommendations. You know the drill: Eat mostly veggies, fruits, beans, and whole grains, don't overeat, engage in enjoyable physical activities, get adequate rest.

{"reviewerID": "A1EX319KWE81UL", "asin": "0002007649", "reviewerName": "Warren Green", "helpful": [8, 21], "reviewText": "I bought this book based on two 5 star customer reviews, and because at the time, it was 94th in books at amazon.ca. I've purchased many books on nutrition from amazon. This is the only one I sent back.Coming from a Canadian author, I was hoping to like this book, but after reading the small section entitled \"Milk and Calcium\", I lost a lot of respect for this man as a \"nutrition authority\".I think the author could have produced a better book, if he'd written in greater depth, on fewer subjects, the ones he was most knowledgeable on. Dairy foods are not one of these subjects, and his bias in their favor is painfully obvious.He portrays the anti-dairy segment of our society as being primarily animal rights and vegetarian organizations, and claims that independent researchers fall on the side of the dairy industry for milk's health benefits.Don't Drink Your Milk!: New Frightening Medical Facts About the World's Most Overrated Nutrient( While this book is dated, the number of medical doctors recommending against consuming dairy products has continued to grow.)He acknowledges that, \"Milk stands accused of contributing to heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, diabetes, allergies, stomach cramps, diarrhea, autism, mucus production, and, get this, bone fractures!\" He fails to acknowledge the theory that's becoming more widely accepted within the nutritional science community for why cow's milk may not be a positive contributing factor for bone health. That the milk proteins can contribute to an acidosis of the blood, pulling calcium from the bones to maintain a stable pH level, and negatively impacting calcium balance in the body. He continues, \"But milk is also linked  with reducing heart disease, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and of course, bone fracture\".\"The anti-milk arguments often begin with the observation that no other species except humans drink milk after weaning.\"( Again, he neglects to mention the rest of the story. That in Nature, no other species would ever consume the \"breast milk\" of another species, regardless of stage of life.) \"That's hardly a compelling argument. No other species designs airplanes, develops antibiotics, or bakes bread either.\"He tries to refute the Nurse's Health Study by suggesting that the nurses who were drinking the most milk, were doing so not because they liked it, but because they knew they had a genetic predisposition and/or other risk factors for osteoporosis, and believed consuming more cow's milk would help them. So, to his way of thinking, drinking more milk was largely a reflection of an overall greater risk for developing osteoporosis in general, and therefore milk should not be singled out and blamed for the increased incidence of hip-fracture seen in the Nurse's Health Study, as the extra milk was possibly beneficial, but just not beneficial enough to overcome the other risks in this \"self-selected subgroup\". While the lead author of this study may lend some support for that hypothesis, her coauthor, Dr. Walter Willett, does not.In this short chapter the author refers to the heavy environmental contamination of dairy as a \"trace of dioxin\". He acknowledges that dairy fat is a problem, but suggests we eat low-fat dairy, and also limit saturated fat in our diets elsewhere.He doesn't get into the tumor-promoting properties of casein, the primary type of milk proteins. Likewise, he stays right away from the whole raw milk issue, or movement, and the destruction of nutrients through pasteurization. There's no discussion on grass-fed, as opposed to grain-fed cows, or any issues relating to factory farming. Although he does give brief mention to insulin-like growth factor.Most people who know anything about nutrition, know that 2% cow's milk actually contains over 30% of calories from fat. The dairy industry likes to mislead, or deceive the public, by measuring \"water\" weight, rather than counting calories.This author pulls a similar stunt with calcium. He boasts, \"A glass of milk contains about 300 milligrams of calcium, a cup of yogurt 400. By comparison, the best vegetable source is broccoli, with about 100 milligrams per cup.\"Of course he's not only wrong about broccoli being the best vegetable source of calcium, ( bok choy and kale are both significantly higher ) but he doesn't bother to mention that a cup of broccoli contains only about a third the calories of a cup of milk, and, like other cruciferous vegetables, broccoli has a far superior nutrient-profile. He does recommend broccoli in a different part of the book.There is some comic relief with the author's explanation for why large segments of the world population are lactose intolerant. Apparently, the human species evolved hand in hoof with the dairy cow. But centuries ago, the tsetse fly spread sleeping sickness throughout much of Africa and Asia, decimating cattle populations. So, not having access to cow's milk, human populations, over time, lost much of their \"natural\" ability to make lactase, the enzyme responsible for lactose digestion.While some primitive populations did thrive on diets containing some cow's milk, it's important to make the distinction that what they consumed is a far cry from what is available to us at the grocery store. Derived largely from grain-fed cows, pumped up on growth hormone to increase milk production, and antibiotics to ward off sickness inherent to the animal's living conditions, much of the already compromised nutrition in the milk is destroyed through pasteurization. And dairy fat today, contains more dioxin, and more environmental contaminates in general, than any other food North Americans are likely to consume.The author claims that while \"milk may not be a miracle food, it can contribute significantly to a healthy diet. It assuredly is not poison, as suggested by the likes of PETA\".Webster's Dictionary defines poison as, \"a substance that through it's chemical action can injure or kill\".It's debatable whether cow's milk, as it's generally produced today, is actually poison, but it most assuredly is, as the Weston A. Price Foundation acknowledges, crap!While \"milk and calcium\" is admittedly a very very small portion of this book, in my eyes, the author has seriously undermined his credibility.

No!Who do I trust?If you want to know what the medical literature says about diet and health, read Joel Fuhrman'sEat to Live: The Revolutionary Formula for Fast and Sustained Weight Loss", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "We Design Airplanes, Therefore We Should Drink Cow's Milk?", "unixReviewTime": 1228867200, "reviewTime": "12 10, 2008"}

Jacob, a young adult, naive, still a virgin, unused to such a hard life on the road, confronts danger, murder, hatred, love, callous human viciousness, more danger, and finds friends and allies (not all of them human) in the unlikeliest of places.The story is told in turn, by the nonogenarian Jacob now in a nursing home, and at other times, by the twenty-something Jacob working at the circus and trying not to get killed -- mostly at the hands of his fellow-human-associates. Every chapter is an adventure, held my attention and took turns gladdening, saddening and surprising me.The circus animals also get into the act in this book and the author's sensitive rendering and treatment of them makes them all the more vivid, as \"supporting actors\",  Circus \"employees\", and fellow participants in the intrigue and action.A masterful ending -- leaving the reader with hope, glee and wonder.

I'm not sure why I waited so long to finally read this book. From the prologue, this book held my attention. Gruen's writing style and attention to detail is simply amazing! At several points, I felt as though I was actually watching the show or walking beside Jacob while working in the menagerie. It felt real. And the perverse, morbid sense of humor she gives Jacob as an elderly gentleman is laugh-out-loud hilarious! Although, I must admit, I found myself fuming over the treatment of our senior citizens. That, however, is a rant for another time!The characters in this book are so rich and deep. It was hard not to form some sort of fondness for them. In addition, I found it amazing that Gruen was able to turn Rosie into a full character without completely humanizing her. Even though I have a strong bond to animals, I still felt a close connection to Rosie.From a lot of her terminology, knowledge of trains, animals, freaks, etc., I really think that Gruen did a lot of research before writing this book. It makes it a lot more authoritative and realistic. While the story itself is fiction, it makes it that much more believable and credible to be interspersed with fact.I will say that the happy ending, Jacob's extreme sensitivity, etc. might be seen as extremely campy. However, I felt that Gruen was trying to find something positive during the Depression. I feel that she did try to capture that, even though there was food a shelter, life on a train circus was not good either. The Depression was hard on everyone, and no one was left unaffected. So, while there was romanticizing occurring in the novel, it felt as though she was trying to make a fairytale in an unlikely setting. To me, that makes it even more endearing and tender. Many reviews I have read complain that she is trying to push an agenda with some of the issues she tackles, but, to me, this was just a romantic love story of two people finding each other against all odds. I do, however, have to laugh a little at the ending. That part might have been a bit over the top", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Well Done", "unixReviewTime": 1335744000, "reviewTime": "04 30, 2012"}

You find yourself running alongside Jacob, and taking part of the daily activities of the circus. The characters are highly developed, and you hate, love, and grow with each one of them. The author takes time to even develop the animals which I feel helps readers bond to the very world they now find themselves in.

We are first presented with Jacob Jankowski as an elderly man in a nursing home. The old coot may have problems with his short-term memory, but he certainly has a terrific long-term memory when it comes to remembering the details of his youthful days in a travelling circus. I thought that I had no interest whatsoever in the workings of a depression-era circus, including the care of the exotic animals and the various freaks and acts. However, the author depicts this unique microcosm of humanity with such passion and color that I found myself absolutely absorbed in the story early on.Adding to the historic ambience of this saga are the well-chosen photographs at the start of each chapter: a man with a deformed human growing from his stomach; a woman proudly showing off her bare upper extremities; excited people milling around the big top...It is the undercurrent of spiritual darkness that makes this story fly so high. Gruen depicts the battle between good and evil with stunning accuracy: the greed of Uncle Al; the brutality of August; the surprising kindness of the abandonned dwarf, Walter; and the meek vulnerability of Marlena and her animals.The scene with the drunkard Camel being told that he is dying of poisoning from Jamacai ginger extract is poignant. This, followed by scenes with Camel being cared for in a box car by Walter and Jacob. Stirring, because alternating chapters depict a now elderly Jacob in a similar position of helplessness.In sum, a GREAT book. Whoever thought that an elephant would carry such literary weight?

You feel the pain, the joy, the laughter. When the book is finished, you're more than disappointed. You feel invigorated, and you search eagerly through the author's books to see what, along the same vein, she has to offer. You search readers' recommendations to find the books that leave the same imprint on you. Inevitably, though the books satiate your appetite, they don't resonate in the same way. Welcome to Sara Gruen's Water for Elephants.In the prologue, we're privy to a murder. We see it as Jacob sees it, and tries in vain to stop it. Though the victim and murderer aren't named, as we're introduced to them, it becomes clear in our mind who filled those roles.Then we start from the beginning, in the midst of the Great Depression. Jacob is in class, during the final few weeks at Cornell preparing for his finals before he becomes a doctor of veterinary medicine.In a moment, the Dean will enter and change his path. Jacob was to go home and set up shop with his father, working with the animals in his town. Instead, he goes home to identify the remains of his mother and father. He sees the sign his father added to their on-site practice: Jankowitz and Son Veterinary Practice. After identifying his family, he visits the lawyer, who tells him he has nothing. The bank owns the house and everything in it. The explanation as to why his parents mortgaged the house shatters him. He returns to school to finish his finals and finds that he can't.Jacob flees and seeing a train pass, tries to jump aboard. Once on, he realizes it is a circus train. An old man, Camel, vouches for him and works to get him a job within.As soon as the boss finds he is Ivy League educated, degree or no degree, he becomes the animal man. With such a prestigious job within, he straddles the division between the higher ups and performers, and the lower echelon who helped secure his place.One performer in particular, Marlena, fascinates him. She reminds him physically of the girl he left behind at school, and emotionally captivates him. She matches his love of animals. Married to August, who has the boss' ear, she is off-limits, but a friendship develops anyway.Later comes Rosie, an elephant pilfered from a circus that has gone defunct. Rosie suffers August's wrath many, many times. Jacob is stunned by her human like qualities. Understanding, pain, anger, empathy, happiness all emanate from her big brown eyes.Following the story, I felt all of the emotions Rosie feels (except perhaps, the pain). Astonishment at the goings on to keep the circus running smoothly. The love Jacob develops for many people who help him in the course of creating a new life for himself, free of the memories surrounding his past. Sadness at the loss of animals, anger at the treatment of the animals and the red lighting of, as they're called today, carnies.The characters came alive to me, as did the setting. As soon as I finished this book, I eagerly went to Sara Gruen's website to read excerpts of other novels she had written. While good, they didn't capture me the way this did. And I wanted more of this. So I went to Amazon's recommendations Disappointedly, I moved on to Barnes and Noble. No dice. So I tried the next best thing. Research. I wanted to read first hand accounts of the circus the way it was back then. The more I read, the more I craved.Then, as though they knew my hunger, work offered me discounted tickets to the circus. I'm still debating. On the one hand, it's the circus. Elephants that feel things like people do! Horses that synchronize! How can I say no? On the other hand, it's not the 1920s. It's almost 100 years later. What if it's not the same? I mean true, we're in the middle of a depression (point 4 of pros: It's almost the same!). But people are categorically different than they were then. Theoretically, this extends to performers as well right?But alas, I have chosen to forego the circus at this moment, because I fear, like the recommendations of Barnes and Noble and Amazon, it may fall short. So I will hold onto the satisfaction this book gave me, and the hunger for more of the same. Hopefully, there will be another book that catches my attention like this one.

Hamilton", "helpful": [0, 0], "reviewText": "Book DescriptionAs a young man, Jacob Jankowski was tossed by Fate onto a rickety train that was home to the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. It was the early part of the great Depression, and for Jacob, now ninety or ninety-three, the circus world he remembers was both his salvation and a living hell. A veterinary student just shy of a degree, he was put in charge of caring for the circus menagerie. It was there that he met Marlena, the beautiful equestrian star married to August, the charismatic but twisted animal trainer. And he met Rosie, an un-trainable elephant who was the great hope for this third-rate traveling show. The bond that grew among this unlikely trio was one of love and trust, and, ultimately, it was their only hope for survival.[...]This book came to us as a recommended read from several sources. Once selected, we could not possibly put it down. The author, Sara Gruen, builds the detailed and fantastic world of a travelling circus during the Great Depression from the ground up! The story of Jacob Jankowski is one of sorrow, love and at times terrifying. His constant emotional struggles can be related to by many readers (though perhaps not as fantastical) and will captivate the imagination. The other characters Gruen constructed are perhaps the most remarkable outside of young Jacob, as with any circus, they all act their parts accordingly ... with flawless precision.One does not need to be a circus aficionado or historical reader to take pleasure in this novel, for it contains a little of everything to captivate any bookworm.

Water for Elephants is of the former variety.  It's a quick read and a good read, but it is not a great book.Ms. Gruen was thorough in her research, so the reader does get some feeling for the gritty world of the \"train circus\", yet I felt when I finished the book that I had no clear sense of who the characters were.  Jacob is a nebulous character as a young man, and a shallow one in old age.  As for the rest of the \"cast\", well, when they are good they are very very good, and when they are bad they are...monsters.  Rosie the elephant is one of the more developed characters!The author doesn't seem to have a good ear for speech, either.  Any of the book's dialog could come from any character's mouth, for the most part, and some of the things Jacob says (or says in his mind) as an old man seem to land with a clunk.  They just don't fit.Add to that a slightly corny ending and a structure that comes out of any pulp murder mystery (old person recalling a murder, then going back to the start of the story and working back up to the murder...with a twist), and you get just a middling-good book.I am vehemently against the use (abuse) of animals in circuses, so I was happy to see that animal abuse was part of this story.  In fact, I think the author cleaned it up a bit too much (few facts about the orangutan and the chimpanzee, for instance..it's sickening what the higher apes were subject to, and still are).  What I think she could have cut back on is the gratuitous details about sex and the cooch tent.

Having finished, I'm mystified about the huge number of five-star reviews.I don't know much about circuses so I can't comment on the quality of the author's research efforts, although I see other reviewers have pointed out shortcomings. What jumps at me, however, are the one-dimensional characters and overly contrived nature of key plot points.It's never easy for an author to pull off a first-person narrative from the vantage point of the opposite gender, and I wish Sara Gruen hadn't tried to speak through a male character. It seemed fine in the parts where he was speaking as a 90-something, but the young-man version fell flat. Often during the romantic and erotic interludes I found myself thinking Jacob sounded way too feminine.August, the primary villain, was way too over-the-top: animal abuser, wife beater, paranoid schizophrenic (so labeled by August, the main boss), etc. Why is he even part of the circus. I think the author should have established some merits, enough to justify employing him. Of course August, the owner, is just as one-dimensionally rotten, so perhaps no merit was needed.I was also appalled at the self-centered irresponsible behavior on the part of Jacob, the so-called hero, who seemed quite willing to indulge his own \"love\" needs completely mindless of the horrific consequences likely to result for his friends. I don't want to go into detail which would force too many spoilers. Suffice it to say that I strongly believe that Jacob, the narrator and main character, absolutely positively does NOT deserve the long and largely happy life he'll eventually get to lead. It's one thing to care about animals and less fortunate humans. That test, Jacob passes with flying colors. But when it comes to moderating one's own urges and balancing them against the well-being of others (all others close to you, not just Marlena, the love interest), Jacob gets a huge F-.", "overall": 1.0, "summary": "Overrated - Shallow characters", "unixReviewTime": 1336867200, "reviewTime": "05 13, 2012"}

The backdrop is the 1930's, and the book throws you into the era of carnivals, Prohibition, and the Great Depression.  You're led by slums with hobos, and everyone is dying for regular pay and something to eat.The story bounces back and forth between a man living out his twilight years in a nursing home, and his 23-year-old self... where circumstances find him joining a circus.  Life revolves around the train for these guys - they always travel in cramped space with all kinds of memorable characters.There are some great anecdotes so strange you'd think they were true.  My favorite was Rosie the bull elephant sneaking lemonade by pulling her stake out of the ground, and then being smart enough to replace it to avoid getting caught.The author respects the reader enough to let him figure out what's happening from contextual clues.  For instance, a show horse is put down, and the starving lions miraculously wind up fed.  You have to connect the dots to understand the whole story.Another positive: this book is not a tear-jerker and avoids supernatural components, unlike other popular fiction (e.g. Dean Koontz).

There was a total disconnect for me with any of the characters specifically between Jacob and Marlena.  I thought their love story lacked passion of any kind.  For me, it felt like the only thing keeping them together was the horses and later Rosie.  It wasn't until half way through the book when Jacob finally admits he's in love with her and it's so lackluster I didn't really believe it.  Perhaps I feel this way because I had just finished reading \"Wurthering Heights\" before this and expecting more passion between the young lovers; however I'm not interested in reading this book again to find out if that's true.......which is saying a lot.  I thought the most interesting part of the book was the Q&A portion at the end where Gruen talks about her research and how all the events that took place on and off the train were based on real events that happened to various circus's during that time.  Knowing that did kind of put those events into prospective, but not really being interested in circus history is where it failed to capture me.

The author does a great job of the writer's maxim \"show, don't tell,\" revealing bits and pieces to fill in the details and background of characters over time. The main character, Jacob, is very funny, especially when he's a 93-year old with attitude. I felt so sorry for old Jacob after a while. I really wanted to get back to young Jacob and hoped for a happy ending. Without giving anything away, I was incensed at one point about what happened to old Jacob. I hated that part so much that I questioned all the favorable reviews. However, I must say that I'm satisfied with the ending and glad that I read the book.

No problem, I wasn't in a hurry.Regarding adult themes (beware potential SPOILERS below):I'm definitely NOT a fan of inserting graphic sex or nudity or swearing into a story for no reason. I prefer nice clean stories and think you really don't need to be explicit. However, I think the scenes in this story helped set the environment. They were typically treated with such humor that I laughed a lot and didn't mind them. First, young virgin Jacob guards a stripper while she performs. The striptease and gigantic breasts are described in vivid detail. Jacob's horror, amazement, and embarassment, having never seen a naked woman before shows he's really not in Kansas any more. That's the most explicit scene and it's really hilarious. There are a few other sexual situations, often mixed with drinking. The actual love making was left to the imagination. There's a little swearing. I found the beating of animals to be the most objectionable; Jacob, the animal lover, spends a lot of time trying to figure out how to help.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Rich Characters; Beware of Adult Themes", "unixReviewTime": 1318377600, "reviewTime": "10 12, 2011"}

My main problem with the novel, however, is that the characters are one dimensional.  They always seem to be doing dramatic things and facing tragedy after tragedy, but I couldn't connect because there is very little reflection or internal monologue (not even in the retirement home!).  The story clips along at such a quick pace it gets bogged down by its own far-fetched events.  I found it difficult to understand why the characters, and even Rosie the elephant, act the way they do--everything seems trumped up to make the plot work.

I got the connection to the man in the retirement home who claimed he carried water for elephants, but what in the heck did this have to do with the story?

They're right; the author does make you empathize with her characters.  When reading, I felt like I was right with the characters, watching them.  Many reviewers also emphasize and appreciate the book's unusual story.  The story really does have wonderful historical flavor.  Most of the characters participate in a 1930s traveling circus, and reading about this circus-society is entertaining and informative.Now, for all of that, the book's writing was nothing extraordinary.  While Sara Gruen tells a unique story, she is not a unique storyteller.  Her writing was too common for me, too similar to the writing styles of so many authors who are currently alive.As I was reading, I kept asking myself, \"Have I read anything by this author before?\"  The truth was, I had never read anything else by her.  But I felt like I had, because her writing style and word choices were nothing new to me.I imagine that, in a couple years, I won't be able to remember reading this book.  Perhaps I'll hear someone talk about it, and I'll get a feeling of deja-vu and say, \"Oh yeah.  I think I might have read something like that, at some point.\"Again, don't get me wrong; this was an engaging book.  It was entertaining, and I cared about the characters.  It was a good read, and well worth my time.  I happily recommend it to people who want to be entertained, and who might like to read about the circus.  Just don't expect anything amazing.Oh, and if you don't like violence or scenes with sexual content, you should probably stay away.

Then it struck me that I was strongly remindedof Stephen King's \"The Green Mile\" when I read the old Jacob sections (very old man in an old person's home reminiscing about anoddly sentient animal while struggling to retain his identity in the face of unsympathetic caregivers). There's even the Popeye/Olive Oyl8-pager which is also referenced in \"The Green Mile\".  The Jacob/Marlena/August triangle was similar to the onein William Styron's \"Sophie's Choice\" (volatile charming Jewish man with a personality  disorder married to a younger sensitive woman, theyoung man taken under the older man's wing falling in love with the wife, resulting in violence and upheaval).But beyond that, the Jacob/Marlena love story was very poorly developed. Marlena never came together as a three-dimensionalcharacter.  When older Jacob talks about his wife and how she was his helpmeet at the beginning of the book, a weak, passive character such as Marlena was not the woman I pictured. I certainly don't understand why he fell so deeply in love with her. The ending was feel-good but nevertheless unsatisfying due to its lack of realism.The few plus points in this book are the quirky secondary characters such as Walter and Camel. The thematic setting of a traveling circus was also interesting but after reading the author interview included with the Kindle version, it seems a lot of the side plots and atmospheric color were lifted largely unaltered from actual instances the author read or heard about while researching the book.Given the hype, I didn't expect a book that I will barely remember in another month except for its similarity to other, better works.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "Disappointing and derivative", "unixReviewTime": 1324339200, "reviewTime": "12 20, 2011"}

As many have said, it is a very interesting subject, but it could have been done much better.  I'll preface this by saying that I hardly ever read contemporary fiction, so perhaps I'm just not used to the modern style of writing.  Most fiction I read is from the era when a book could not be published if there was too much \"obscenity\" or if it was too graphic.Nonetheless, here's where I felt this novel fell short:As others have noted, it felt too contemporary.  Some of the language didn't seem to fit the times. I know the \"f\" word and other swearing has been around forever, but I almost never hear people from that generation use it. Also, young Jake laments being a virgin so much, but from talking with people who came of age before the sexual revolution, it was pretty much expected that one would remain that way until marriage. Even Hugh Hefner was a virgin until his mid 20s.The character of Jake was not convincing. I didn't get a good sense of who he really was as a young man, and the young Jake and the old Jake could have been two different people as far as I could tell.I didn't find the old Jake to be very symphathetic.  I felt bad for him for being trapped in a nursing home, but he gave the nurses a hard time and picked fights with another male resident which canceled out a lot of sympathy I would have had for him.  Also, I had trouble with Jake's situation.  If he couldn't even remember his family members who came to visit or the names of the nurses who took care of him, how come he could always remember the names and details of his fellow residents with no problem?A lot of reviewers had trouble reading the scenes about animal cruelty. I love animals, but I didn't have that much trouble reading them because I wasn't really convinced by the writing.As many others have said, the ending is unrealistic. Some people may not be bothered by this, but that's one thing that irks me.On the positive side, it was entertaining.

The story unfolds in two time frames from the first-person point of view of Jacob Jankowski.  As a twenty-three year old vet traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth and as a ninety-three year old man confined to an assisted living facility and repulsed by the sight of his aging body, his ever-sharp mind moves us effortlessly between the two time periods.  We are told he is about to reveal a secret he has kept hidden for seventy years----and what a story it is!In 1931, a tragic accident takes his parents from him and leaves him alone and penniless in the midst of the Great Depression.  The circus is both his salvation and his personal hell as he signs on to care for the animals.  Jacob and the characters he encounters are drawn so vividly that you will remember them long after the last page is read:  Marlena, the pink-sequined star of the equestrian act; her mercurial husband August who suffers with bouts of paranoid schizophrenia; Walter, the dwarf whose mother sold him to the circus, and Camel, the first member of the circus to befriend Jacob will all make you laugh and cry and cry again.  But it is Rosie, the lemonade-stealing elephant, who will steal a piece of your heart and cause you never to look at elephants in quite the same way again.Heartbreaking, poignant, and with a double surprise of an ending, this amazing plot unfolds with actual circus stories the author tells us in her end note that she has taken from real life.  Peppered with antique photos of long-ago circuses, this is an amazing book not only of circus life but of a man coming to grips with his diminished capacity and the aging flesh surrounding his ever-young heart.

Destined to be passed among family and friends and back again, until the tattered, timeworn pages resemble the books beloved central character and narrator.Jacob Jankowski had studied Veterinary Medicine and was days from exams when his parents were killed in an auto accident. Alone, frightened and penniless, he hopped a train, never intending to \"run away with the circus\".... It was the midst of the depression and life was hard. Joining the Benzini Brothers Circus would change his life again. From town to town, day after day, set it up, tear it down-the freaks and geeks, midgets and clowns worked, ate, lived and often died together. The harsh conditions are made even more unbearable by the greedy manager and his insane animal trainer. Yet somehow, in the midst of despair, friendships and laughter persevered. Although much of the laughter was alcohol induced, during the height of the depression and prohibition, you took what you could get.The narrator's transition from the young circus vet, to the elderly, cantankerous nursing home resident, is a well-crafted, bi-lateral view that pulls the reader into this fictional world and never lets go. Whether in his twenties, admiring the beautiful equestrian performer, Marlena, and caring for the animals he loved-or in his nineties, complaining about the indignities of old age, the warm, quick wit comes through loud and clear. From the big top to the nursing facility Gruen's sharp, three-dimensional, fictionally fluid characters will have you laughing out loud one minute, mouth agape in disgust the next.Hurry, hurry, step right up, readers and book lovers everywhere. If you hunger for a reading experience chock full of every conceivable emotion, beautifully written and wholly engrossing, Water for Elephants is a wondrous world, where fact and fiction combine, delivering the most memorable and pleasurable hours, you will be spend with a book.

Part of its appeal was the promise of a circus story. And the story was very realistic in some ways, detailing how difficult and unrewarding (not to mention very dangerous)that life could be.Some of the most interesting and moving parts of the book were actually those that took place in the nursing home that Jacob now lives in, remembering his youth with the circus. The author did a great job in describing the sadness, loneliness and other problems that befall the very aged. Especially those nearly forgotten by their families. Their cold treatment at the hands of people who barely see these elderly souls as human is all too real, having witnessed this myself when working in this type of facility. And another reason why I got out of nursing.The love story was so-so, and years were wrapped up too quickly, at least for my taste. I looked forward to more stories of Jacob as the circus veterinarian. There was alot of potential there for interesting and moving stories about the animals, but that aspect was barely touched upon. Rather it was more about Jacob's obsession with the beautiful Marlena.I loved many of the interesting characters, but always felt I did not quite know them in spite of their frequent appearances throughout the story. Walter the dwarf as an example. He was one of my favorite characters. I found myself wanting more of his own story, but it wasn't there.I would recommend this as a light summer read, but would not look for more than an interesting diversion and brief look into the world of the circus folk when the animals were still transported by train and when the circus coming to town was the biggest news of the month.", "overall": 3.0, "summary": "Anyone looking for a quick, light read", "unixReviewTime": 1282694400, "reviewTime": "08 25, 2010"}

While he has many family members, his children are now old themselves and the family in general has moved on without him. They take turns visiting him, but he gets the feeling their hearts are not into it.Mr. Jankowski maintains his sanity by thinking back to his days as a young man in his prime. The story into the past begins with him finishing up veterinary school at Cornel. His plan is to join his father's practice, but, just before he finishes his final exam, he gets the news that his parents have been killed in a car wreck. To add to the tragedy, he finds out that his parents were bankrupt and losing their family house and everything they own, a result of the bad economy and them putting all their money into Jacob's education at Cornel. He responds by joining the Benzini Brothers Greatest Show on Earth.His journey down memory lane provides us a rich assortment of protagonists and antagonists, and a loving, touching account of the animals that were under his care as the official veterinarian of the circus. He falls in love with the star of the circus, but she is married to a brute, having been sold off to him while she was still a child. Jacob has constant run ins with her lover, as the man is in charge of training the animals for the circus acts. The man is a barbarian, often mistreating the animals, his wife, the workers, and he and Jacob rumble several times.The owner of the circus is a two-bit conman that often physically abuses his workers, and more often than not--it seems--fails to pay them. This of course leads to great friction with the working men, some of whom disappear during some of the train rides, thrown off the moving train under the orders of the mad man in charge of the circus.Along the way, the circus picks up a prized elephant, named Rosie, who does not respond to any commands and is judged to be a worthless animal with an alarming appetite. The trainer responds by beating the elephant on several occasions. Jacob intervenes and figures out the elephant responds to Polish, which provides the circus new life, with Rosie emerging as the star of the circus, along with Jacob's love, Marlena.There are several wonderful side stories that outline the struggles of the wonderful array of characters that make up the circus crew. They travel around in the Depression, attempting to survive when most circuses are folding their tents and going out of business.I loved the ninety-plus-year old Jacob and especially his flashbacks to earlier days that showed the wonders, dangers, opportunities, underhandedness, splendors and tragedies of life on the train circus. The story tells how difficult it is to age, to become old, to be viewed as no longer capable of living a normal life. It also is a story that tells us to follow our dreams when we are young and do all we can to make them come true.Ms. Gruen provides a fitting ending to the book. I will not spoil it for you, but you are certain to like and appreciate it.This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend.Hey Joe (Jamaica Series)", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a great book", "unixReviewTime": 1374192000, "reviewTime": "07 19, 2013"}

I read a library copy for my book club, but after I finished I promptly ordered three copies: for my father, for a favorite aunt, and for my husband. I had to restrain myself from buying more.The book is narrated from the point of view of Jacob Jankowski, a ninety-plus year old man living in a nursing home. He is unhappy with everything about his current situation in life. He constantly flails against the every-present reminders that his body has degenerated so that he hardly recognizes himself. He's become the trouble-making curmudgeon of the facility because his mind is fully alive and has not degenerated along with his body.When a circus comes to town and sets itself up across the street, one of the old coots living in the same home brags that he used to work in the circus carrying \"water for elephants.\" This gets Jacob's ire up. He knows you can't carry water to elephants. They drink too much! The man is lying. Jacob knows the truth because he really did work in the circus. But those memories are long buried. Now that thoughts of this part of his past are awakened, he starts thinking about those halcyon days of his youth--a time when he learned quickly how to become a man.Thus the story of Jacob joining the circus when he was 23, during the heart of the Depression, when he had nothing in the world he could call his own except promise, inner strength, and fortitude. The world couldn't get any tougher for a young man. He learns quickly, and the hard way about many of the most important lessons in life, and he comes away from the experience a remarkably mature, whole, and admirable man.Two-thirds of the book deals with chapters about Jacob as a young man in the circus. One-third deals with Jacob in the nursing home. It is a proper balance and this construction adds to the tension of the story rather than detracts. You care about this man and root for him in both periods of his life.There is a marvelous feel-good ending, full of great humanity. When you finish, you are left with optimism and enthusiasm that sticks with you for a long time. I recommend this book highly. It is a book that can be appreciated by all ages; in fact, I think it would make an enjoyable and thought-provoking young adult title--but for those men and women who actually went through the Great Depression, this book is a treasure. Buy it for every one of those beloved survivors that you have in your immediate circle of friends and family. These people want for nothing material. It is hard to buy presents for them.

Enduring his final days with other old folks, Jacob loathes his surroundings and how he is treated by the medical staff. Then, one day, a circus sets up stakes not far from Jacob's retirement facility and memories of life-gone-by come flooding back to him.We time-travel with Jacob (in his mind, not the science fiction kind), and learn of a short span that changed Jacob's life. Preparing for his final exams in veterinary school, Jacob soon learns of his parents' demise in a deadly car accident. Running away from his problems, Jacob joins up with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Hired on initially as a rube, Jacob's talents with animals soon come to light and he's assigned as the shows official vet. But trouble, love, and loss await him as he travels the rails with the show. Falling for a married woman, trying to fit in with the grunts versus the performers, battling the show's muscle-bound brutes that carry out Uncle Al's orders (Uncle Al owns the show) and trying to keep from being red-lighted (being thrown from the train), Jacob's short stint in the circus circuit changes everything about him.Author Sara Gruen's easy reading style lends itself to a fast, fun, and interesting read. It also, surprisingly, has a ton of character depth, and not just for human characters but for the animals Jacob tends. Particularly that of Rosie the \"dumb as hammers\" elephant that turns out to be much, much more than what she seems.The ending to WATER FOR ELEPHANTS was absolutely perfect, letting us know that even though the elderly can be crotchety, they serve a much greater purpose than to be wheeled around in chairs and told when, what and where to eat, drink, and think.

Jacob; who is incensed at this obviously false claim, and alienates himself from the rest of the residents, begins to relive, through a series of remembrances in his mind, his own experiences in the Benzini Brothers circus in his youth.With a cast as colorful as the balloons and flags that you can imagine flying over the bigtop of the Benzini Brothers circus, Jacob's internal narrative weaves a tale of love, loss, betrayal, and murder that is as fine a coming of age story as I have ever read.A thoroughly enjoyable read from start to finish.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A Wonderful Read", "unixReviewTime": 1212105600, "reviewTime": "05 30, 2008"}

All of this is given to us from the senescent eyes of one \"90 or 93\", and it leaps through his semi-dementia-blurred eyes to his eyes as they were decades past -- the animated, vibrant mind of a large, strong and most admirable, but real, young man, Jacob/Jake Jankowski, a vetenarian, trained at Cornell University among America&#8217;s elite privileged classes, who fell into the depths of the morass of the Americana that one would expect circus-life to reflect.&#8203;Her novel is a much-heralded classic, as modern literature might define it, even if its prose are not of classical stature; the story that she weaves is captivating indeed.  She presents this historical-fiction view of circus life primarily as dialogue, very believable at that and so worth the time to read it, but it wants for more descriptive passages and philosophy to feed our starved minds.  Still, when she is of a mind to do so, she writes memorable lines, thus sprinkling her fascinating plot with tasteful, descriptive metaphors and similes which never impede the flow of the story line nor irritate the spellbound reader.  The plot drifts dreamlike between the disquieting realities of old age and its debilitating manifestations and the all-too vivid memories of circus life and the tragic and wonderful characters and griping events that then unfold.&#8203;Clearly, she has studied seniors and their halting routines in assisted living facilities, and she makes them all too real.  With this, I have two problems.  First, seniors' lives are boring and, worse, awash in sadness.  Second, for one of my age, they strike frighteningly close to home, increasing the appeal of some later self-extinction, a far preferable denouement than the gradual withering and atrophy that time assures.  As such, I rapidly flipped through the chapters dwelling on Jacob's painful, senescent existence.  On balance, I horoughly enjoyed learning so much about circus life in America some 100 years ago and all of the characters and plots of WFL.  Brava, Sara Guen.

He drops everything when his parents die and joins the circus.Jacob was a very easily liked character. I'd have to say the flash forwards were something I really enjoyed. Gruen's seamless writing between past and present is breathtaking. Reading the difference between an older Jacob as opposed to a young one was really intriguing. It was interesting to hear him describe how his body has aged from the vital, handsome young man he once was and how he sees himself as this decrepit old man now. It was so sad but quite hysterical at the same time.I didn't feel like I connected with Marlena too much. Yes, I liked her as a character, but I had a hard time seeing what Jacob thought was so special about her. A character I had a hard time deciding whether or not I liked, from the moment he was introduced, was August. In the beginning you want to like him when he's befriending Jacob, but when he starts slipping up and showing that he is really a very cruel man you immediately switch to despising him.Now Rosie... what can I say about Rosie? She is the cutest elephant ever! I love how Gruen wrote her with such a loveable personality. Well, really how she wrote most of the animals with such great characteristics. Bobo the monkey was also super adorable. Needless to say, something that I had a hard time with while reading this was the animal cruelty. A while back, I read an article from PETA on how elephants - most circus animals, really - are treated and it was just awful. So it was really hard reading it in gruesome detail. But hopefully, it'll make people realize how circus animals are treated so they can make a stand against it.Overall, Gruen has created a beautifully written novel. Her vivid descriptions and accurate portrayal of life in the circus during the Depression were captivating. Not once did I feel that the story dragged on and the ending left me satisfied. I also felt that the pictures of the circus at the beginning of the chapters were a nice touch.I can't wait to see if I love the movie as much as I loved the book.

He has few pleasures in life --- an astute and friendly nurse named Rosemary and his vibrant memories. As Jacob lies in his bed, drifting in and out of sleep, lucidness and dreams, the compelling story of his experiences as a young man unfolds in Sara Gruen's mesmerizing new novel, WATER FOR ELEPHANTS.The year is 1932. Jacob is 23 and just shy of getting his degree in veterinary medicine from Cornell when he learns that his parents have been killed in a horrific accident. Emotionally and monetarily stranded, unmoored and with nothing to lose, Jacob jumps a train and finds himself traveling with the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Starting at the bottom rung of the strict caste system within the ranks of the Circus employees, Jacob's veterinary knowledge quickly garners him a place near the top of the hierarchy, among the company of the hot-headed ringmaster August and his beautiful wife Marlena --- the all-purpose female star of the show.He also finds himself among the company of cantankerous midgets, gloriously endowed \"men's entertainers\" and a menagerie of exotic and soulful creatures. In her previous novels, Gruen has proven herself a master at depicting the uncanny and often astounding bond between humans and animals, and the scenes with Jacob and the creatures under his care are nuanced and lovely. Gruen paints each creature's persona with as much care and detail as she does for the humans, subtly illuminating the similarities and undermining the concept of human superiority. In the Depression-era setting of Jacob's tale, the survival of the humans is inextricably intertwined with that of the animals; they all live in a kind of chaotically symbiotic state where a star horse's sickness could spell bankruptcy and the chance for redemption lies in the acquisition of an elephant named Rosie.Exceptionally drawn as well is the development of a tentative bond between Jacob and Marlena. Jacob immediately is attracted to the lovely Marlena. She takes longer to reciprocate his affection, and throughout their cautious and hesitant budding romance the presence of Marlena's husband looms large and threatening. Gruen's pacing is excellent and the tension among Marlena, Jacob and August simmers and crackles before coming to a brutal and electrifying climax.The transitions back and forth in time, and the mundane events that unfold as Jacob moans and gripes through his days at the nursing home, could have been, in the hands of a less skilled writer, jarring and distracting, breaking the flow and drawing the reader out of the story. But while the crazed, dramatic and often spectacularly bizarre world of the Benzini Brothers is fascinating, as the novel progresses the reader becomes equally drawn into Jacob's present world. His disdain for his aged body and regret over the confusing array of relatives who visit him intermittently and whose names are permanently muddied in his mind is deeply poignant.Gruen spent years researching Depression-era circuses, and the breadth of her knowledge is revealed in all the tiny details that pepper Jacob's memories, but she also has a finely-tuned radar for the magic and mysteries of the human heart. The meat and madness of this novel may appear to lie in Jacob's memories of his younger self, but in her subtle exploration of Jacob as an old man, Gruen finds an equally compelling story.Readers may find themselves churning through this book at a rapid-fire pace, eager to see what lies ahead, then slowing down as they realize the pages are dwindling. WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a book that can be read and reread, recommended and handed off between friends; it begs to be discussed and mulled over. With lines of startling beauty, haunting and evocative scenes and finely-drawn characters who dance off the page, readers can dip in and out of the novel, immersing themselves in Jacob's memories. The story and its characters will haunt readers long after they have resurfaced.--- Reviewed by Jennifer Krieger", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "A book that will leave any reader wanting more", "unixReviewTime": 1149033600, "reviewTime": "05 31, 2006"}

It's such a beautiful and unforgettable story in so many ways, I don't even know where to begin explaining what an absolutely gorgeous must-read this is.The story is told with two voices. It starts with Jacob, a full ninety or ninety and three years old (he can't quite remember), coming to terms with aging and being left on his own by his children, in a facility for the aged; whilst looking back at his time as a drop-out veterinary student when he joined the circus after his parents death. The second voice is of Jacob during the three months he had joined the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth in the summer of 1931, and follows the story of him and Rosie the elephant; and him falling irrevocably in love with another man's wife - a love triangle with a difference, for sure. Both these story lines, Jacob as an old man and twenty three year old Jacob, deals with different sides and facets of Jacob.Sarah Gruen is a master character developer. Main and secondary role players were vividly painted as multi-dimensional characters. She wrote them in such a striking way that before you can stop yourself, you've lost your heart to quite a few of them, including the animals. Rosie, of course, is the star in this book and if nothing else, her trials and tribulations as well as her spectacular sense of humor, had me laughing and wiping tears at the same time.If you've seen the movie but haven't read the book yet, I can guarantee you won't be disappointed. As great as the movie was, the book touched me on so many more levels than I could've imagined. I was riveted by the author's writing and the skilful manner in which she pulled me into Jacob's reality. I experienced so many emotions along with the various characters, and at times felt I could strangle August for what he put Rosie, Marlena and Jacob through.Most memorable line which made me smile: \"Not only am I unemployed and homeless, but I also have a pregnant woman, bereaved dog, elephant, and eleven horses to take care of.\"The well-executed, fast-paced plot - fraught with twists and turns - also had moments of humor woven into it, and I finished this book feeling breathless from the anticipation, excitement and sheer excellence of this imaginative story and its realistically-sketched characters. It was clear to me that the author did in-depth research for this novel. If you don't purchase the book, at least watch the movie.

I had high expectations because of the press from the movie and from the many positive reviews. Unfortunately, few of my expectations were met.What I Like About This Book:It's the Circus. I love the sideshow era and just to read a book that was set in a Circus was entertaining.Easy read. Ending was fun, even if it was a little too neat.What I Did Not Like About This Book:Poor character development, especially the villains. It was obvious everyone hated August and Uncle Al, but not obvious why. Even when we finally see August at his worst, its too little too late. In fact, August loses his mind because he thinks his wife is sleeping with Jake, something that is not quite true yet, but definitely headed that direction. His actions are unjustified, but his anger seems entirely justified - his wife is already having an emotional affair with another man, and has already kissed him. The villains were never developed and because of that, the story was not nearly as engaging or suspenseful as it could have been. The hero also makes some odd decisions that don't match up with his character, like letting August beat the animals.True Love? Nope. Love story seemed contrived. Falls in love at first sight.Rosie the elephant was poorly developed as a character. Almost a background piece in the story.I really can't pinpoint exactly what it was about this book that didn't work, but it definitely didn't. The characters were poorly developed, the love interest and suspense contrived, and it was hard to care a lot about the elephant because we never really got to know her. It's a shame, because I love the idea, but it just did not cut it.If you want to read some great non-fiction about sideshows and entertaining attractions, check out Ricky Jay's books.

Up to about page 190 I found it to be an enjoyable read and had mentioned it to friends. Alas from page 190 onwards I found it losing its grip...maybe it's too long?Most of the characters are underdeveloped to the point that much of the conversation between Jacob and the various circus folks could essentially take place between him and one other - they all sound the same. I've read peoples comments about the trials and tribulations of the characters living through the depression - it doesn't come anywhere close to a classic dealing with the same period, The Grapes of Wrath.The stampede at the end is a tad too contrived, surely the animals would be tearing themselves, and all around them, limb from limb given that they've attacked their handlers in the past. Same goes with Jacobs disappearance from the old peoples home - again too contrived.There is the makings of a great story here but I don't think Gruen is the one to tell it. The opening scenes have Blackie under the authority of Camel and then 3 months down the road Blackie is ejecting Camel from the train? Sorry it doesn't seem credible. August seems like a nasty piece of work but his paranoia was certainly well founded in the end; we're told that he suffers from paranoid schizophrenia but does anyone help him out with it? Just seems a convenient way for Gruen to add a villain in to the mix...and I have to question would circus folks even know what it was in the first place, and surely his wife would have helped him try and figure it out...\"I left my husband\"...\"why?\"...\"he was a paranoid schizophrenic\"...\"ah, OK, cool\"...isn't life a little more complicated than that? And his ultimate demise and how it was conducted is a little far fetched.I guess I'm feeling let down - the book starts off well but alas doesn't maintain the quality. Also found the interview with Gruen to impart nothing of much substance and the \"Questions for Book Groups\" to be of a nature beyond the level of this book - Grapes of Wrath certainly gives rise to concerns about the depression, compassion etc. but this book doesn't. Alas it didn't deliver and I don't think I'll be reading anything else by Gruen based on this.Have to say that I'm a little disgruntled at the thought of Gruen has a couple of dollars of mine and undeservedly so; if I was Gruen I'd be asking myself whether the ending was worthy of the potential shown earlier in the book. Unfortunately, it's books like this that have me buying books secondhand, and for the most part reading the \"classics\"; they're classics as they've withstood the test of time - I can't imagine this book doing so. For authors I like I'm more than happy to buy a book new and in the process pay money to the author, but my disappointment with this book is such that I don't think Gruen deserves any reward for it and makes me realise what a financial risk one is making buying new books from untried authors.Why are there so few contemporary authors out there who are deserving of the praise that seems to be lauded upon them so easily these days?

As he comes to this realization, Jacob stumbles upon the Benzini Brother's Most Spectacular Show on Earth circus train and hops aboard. He quickly secures his place on the show as the menagerie vet, a position that will change his life forever.Sara Gruen weaves an incredibly realistic tale that allows the reader a rare glimpse into the prohibition era circus lifestyle. The amount of tension throughout the book is always palatable. I often found myself clenching my jaw and holding my breath by the end of a chapter. August is a particularly well-developed character, frightening in the most realistic and entirely plausible way. There is a sense of impending destruction and collapse that builds with each paragraph.This tension is gracefully relieved every few chapters by visiting Jacob, age ninety (or ninety-three), in his current state as a resident at an assisted living facility. Through the telling of Jacob's present story, the reader reaches another level of understanding and can comprehend the meaning of Jacob's earlier experiences in entirely new ways. The tale would be much less satisfying without this continuation of the story, however small it may seem.An issue that must be addressed when talking about Water for Elephants is the treatment of animals. Some scenes in the book are very difficult to read, but it's worth reading through. You will fall in love with so many of the animals as though they're human, and you will be satisfied with their redemption.For me, Water for Elephants receives 5/5 stars.

This man is the main protagonist of the novel, who recounts his story from his last days in vet school whose life trajectory takes him to the circus after a tragic incident.  The novel is rich with visual imagery of circus life - the animals, the workers, the performers, the props, the train travel etc - and as rich with the depressing conditions of a nanogenarian living in a nursing home - the daily struggles to handle basic life skills, relationships with the staff and other residents, and, saddest of all, the knowledge of the sense of loss of one's memory, and with that, the eventual loss of connection to relatives.  The narrative moves quickly and aggressively, taking the reader back and forth between the circus and the nursing home, with each venue progressing dramatically towards its conclusion.  The main charcater, Jacob, is sympathetic, and you root for him all the way, accompanying him along his travails of adjustment to circus life and his love interest.  You get wrapped up in the drama and stay along eagerly on the ride.Here are my minor objections(The first is directed at author and editor.):  In a span of two pages the author uses the exact same phrase regarding some anticipated emotion from different characters.  It's jarring to read, and you go back to see if you misread it - but no.  Not a big deal but it interrupted the flow.  Bad enough, but the same phrase (or almost the exact same phrase) appears again near the end of the book about the same emotion, and, once again, I'm jarred and lose the focus of the story.  It seems like an amateurish mistake by author or editor.The other problem I had was that, at times, some of the circus characters were borderline stereoptypical/cartoonish, as if the protagonist is one of a few only real people.  Finally, the concluding chapter had some elements to it of a Hollywood happy ending, with an implausible change of attention from tragedy to negotiation.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "very Good Novel with Some Minor Flaws", "unixReviewTime": 1200614400, "reviewTime": "01 18, 2008"}

Wasser", "helpful": [6, 13], "reviewText": "The archetypical American novel features a solitary protagonist undertaking an odyssey in which he/she confronts both physical and moral challenges and through which he/she emerges with a renewed spirit, transformed by the crucible of confrontations with adversaries, both real and imagined.  Sara Gruen's engaging \"Water for Elephants\" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life.  Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero.  \"Water for Elephants\" is a triumph  --  of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.The innocent Jacob, on the threshold of graduating from Cornell veterinary school and returning to the Midwest to practice medicine with his father, is shattered by the sudden accidental deaths of his parents.  Unmoored from his past and unable to focus on his final examination, he abandons his former life the moment he jumps on board a passing train.  To his astonishment, he has leaped into the midst of a traveling circus, and, thanks to the flinty care of several roustabouts, manages to gain employment with the tawdry Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth, a circus dominated by a sadistic ringmaster and populated by a cast of characters, admirable and evil in equal proportions.  In a manner of weeks, Jacob immerses himself as the circus \"vet,\" forms abiding friendships, falls is love and faces moral dilemmas that tie his conscience into Gordian knots.Some critics have likened Jacob to his biblical counterpart and praised the novel for its allusions to the Bible.  In my opinion, Jacob mirrors a less sanctified model, Huckleberry Finn.  Like Huck, Jacob flees familiar surroundings, flaunts social norms, befriends outcasts and risks his personal safety in order to adhere to a hard-earned sense of conscience and social responsibility.  Both Huck and Jacob confront mendacious adversaries, rejoice in life on the lam and re-invent themselves.  Like Twain, Sarah Gruen writes with inordinate respect about the dispossessed and with painful awareness about the inexplicable capacity for the human heart to do well in the midst of spiritual darkness.  As Twain has written  --  and as Gruen affirms  --  the source of humor is pain.Even the title bespeaks our capacity for misrepresentation.  The elderly Jacob, shunted away by his family in a assisted-living nursing home, excoriates a new resident who has claimed to have carried water in buckets for elephants when he was a youngster.  Aware of an elephant's enormous drinking capacity, Jacob knows a lie when he hears one.  And well he should.  The entire purpose of the traveling circus is deception, an enterprise where rubes are separated from their money by gaping at mangy animals, staring at sideshow freaks (many of whom are frauds) or being serviced by \"exotic dancers.\"  Falsehoods, illusions and duplicity are the moral big tent under which circus performers enchant Depression men and women hungry for escape.  The central conflict of the novel rotates around Jacob's involvement with a married woman and the peculiarly disturbing aspects of her husband's mental state.  This conflict is rife with secrecy, duplicity and tormented twisting of ideas of right and wrong.It is no surprise that this novel is a best-seller.  Written with extraordinary narrative drive, populated by characters who truly represent our national character and animated by a young man whose journey for self-discovery is our own, \"Water for Elephants\" intimately involves us in Jacob Jankowski's search for meaning.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Huck Finn move over, Sara Gruen has created a soul-mate in her majestic novel", "unixReviewTime": 1187136000, "reviewTime": "08 15, 2007"}

Flinging himself aboard the boxcar and inadvertently changing his destiny forever.I absolutely adored this book, alternately falling in love with both Jacob, the crotchety old man and Jacob, the young, moral and penniless circus veterinarian. Water For Elephants transported me to another time and quickly became one of those books I never wanted to end.Author Sara Gruen has researched the depression era circus life down to the smallest of details and I feel that this captivating and vivid story will appeal to almost anyone.Filled with action, adventure and a sweet forbidden romance there is also a fascinating sideshow of secondary characters including a clever Polish Elephant, a grouchy little person as Jacob's roommate and a cruel and schizophrenic animal trainer whose wife Jacob just happens to fall in love with. All of this has been wrapped together with a compelling and innovative behind the scenes look aboard a travelling circus train. Showing us more often then not the darker side of circus life after the big top closes down. This is a love story, a life story, an animal lover's story but above all it's a circus story and who of us hasn't dreamed about running away and joining the circus at some point in our lives? And the ending... *sigh*I can't say enough good about this book, its easily one of my favourite reads this year and with Robert Pattison now taking on the upcoming movie role version of Jacob, I was able to picture him while reading, making it all the more sweeter.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "STEP RIGHT UP FOLKS, RPATZ IS IS PLAYING THE LEAD IN THE MOVIE VERSION", "unixReviewTime": 1278720000, "reviewTime": "07 10, 2010"}

Initially, I did not have any interest in reading this book because it involved a circus and I am not a huge fan of circuses. But at the insistence of some friends, I picked it up and began reading. Boy am I glad I did!Jacob Jankowski is a young man who is thrust mercilessly into the aftermath of the cruelties of life. Despite his circumstances, however, he is a good and honorable man and his compassion and honor shine through on every page of this book. He is a character that reader's immediately fall in love with and can relate to on some level or another. The story itself grabs you instantly and takes you back to a time where traveling circuses were the biggest events in town.Set in the 1930's, Water For Elephants offers a glimpse into a very strange and wonderous world of circus folk during a time when many, if not most, of the country was unemployed and doing anything they could to earn a buck or at least a meal. It was fascinating to read of the lifestyle of the circus workers and how they were treated, how they related to one another, how they treated their animals and what they thought of the townspeople they traveled the country to entertain.Water For Elephants is also a story that tells of the love and life of Jacob and Merlena and their love for the animals that they come to know while working with them in the circus. The book is beautifully and vividly written, the characters well developed and easy to love (or hate as the case may be) and the animals' antics, especially Rosie, will make you laugh out loud.Water For Elephants is a wonderful read and I highly recommend it!", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Awesome!", "unixReviewTime": 1257811200, "reviewTime": "11 10, 2009"}

There are so many varied responses to this book that the author must be in heaven to get so many responses to this book.I first heard of this book last spring when a fellow Amazon reviewer told me that I \"just had to read it.\" I wasn't that inclined since the price was not favorable and the waiting list at the library was too long. However, in my book club, it was the November book to discuss. So when I saw it on the table at the local bookstore for buy three, get one free, I snapped it up. It is not a decision that I have regretted. It is one of the better entertaining books of fiction that I have read this year, if not one of the best. And I read a lot.There are some disaparities in this book as with others, but I think people tend to forget that a work of fiction is simply that, a work of fiction. Not everything's going to \"mesh together\" as in real life. That's why you read nonfiction if you like everything in its proper place and order. This book is simply a fanastic tale of a man facing the end of his life in a dreary nursing home setting, and reliving some of the best moments of his life. A young orphan who happened to jump the train to get away from the tragedy that was his life happened to be on a circus train. He didn't plan to run away to the circus, he just stumbled on the circus train while grieving. And stayed. Fell in love with the most beautiful girl in the world who is happened to be married to the ringmaster. What a story!This novel alternates between Jacob's present and past ~~ he relives the first three months of being in Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Jacob is 90 or 93 (he can't remember which) and seventy years prior, he was the Benzini Brothers' vet, taking care of the underfed animals of that show. He worked with all kinds of people and animals. It was an exciting life ~~ how many people do you know that lived a life like that? Marlena is the wife of the psychotic ringmaster who alternately abused his wife, his animals and co-workers. Rosie is the elephant bull that Uncle Al, the owner of the circus, bought for a song, hoping that Rosie will be the biggest draw to his circus.The descriptions in this novel are lavish. One can see the sawdust in the air as the big top was put up. One can see the cotton candy being spun. One can feel the humiliation of an old man having to take a shower under the watchful eye of the nurse in the nursing home. One can feel his love for the beautiful show girl. And all of this is tied together beautifully, both past and present. It is a glimpse into a life of a man.Why didn't I give it a five star? Simply because I felt that the endings to both stories were rushed. I did not expect it to have such happy endings since the stories were more gritty and realistic.

Wilfong", "helpful": [3, 4], "reviewText": "Water for Elephants is an interesting text because it is not especially well written, the story is pure soap opera, and yet it is an enjoyable read that at times evokes a long gone era. I think it suffers from overly effusive praise and so many readers are bitterly disappointed once they get through it.First, let's look at the strengths of the novel. I enjoyed the evocations of circus and train life. Gruen clearly spent some time working on these descriptions of circus life and there are little Depression era details that were nice historical jewels for the reader to mine. Also effective was her characterization of old Jacob. His voice was witty and biting and he provided the most pleasure of any character in the text. Chapter nineteen of the novel is the saddest depiction of rest home life I have read in literature. A man is forgotten by his family, and the scene is heartbreaking.Now to examine the reasons why this book is unsatisfying. First off the characters from the 1930s parts of the novel are some of the weakest characterizations I have seen in a book in a long time. They are stock characters at best, and the villains are the mustache twirling men from melodrama. It is hard to care about any of the characters because they are so transparently fake. Even more distracting then the weak characterization is the incredibly insipid (and modern sounding) dialogue Gruen puts in their mouths. She has such nice historical details in the setting of the text, why couldn't she also use it in the dialogue?Many readers have found the ending unsatisfying, and although it is ridiculous, it fits the novel so I won't argue with it. The cloying depiction of animals is also a little beyond the pale, but again, I simply had to come to terms with the novel for what it is. It is popular fiction. It is a melodrama you will get caught up in. And for those purposes it is adequate.

The format of an old man looking back at his life was reminiscent of the regretful and poignant tone in the movie.The story is told by Jacob, half about his life now as a 90-year old man, forgotten by his family in a nursing home.  The other half is about Jacob's life as a young man in the circus.  Jacob runs off to join the circus, literally, when he is just about to graduate from college.  Devastated by the loss of his family and fortune, he turns to the only thing he knows and loves--the one connection he has to his veterinarian father--the animals.  Jacob gets a job 'watering the elephants', and one grouchy elephant in particular, as he works as the circus animal veterinarian.  Jacob also has the really dumb luck of falling for Marlena, a trick horse rider.  Marlena just happens to be married to the circus boss, a sadistic man who beats her and the elephants.  The whole situation is a powder keg waiting to explode.Interspersed with this is the story of present-day Jacob and his longing, so tender and sad, that pulls on the heartstrings.  It is a sweet, tragic romance.I loved the parts that explained how the traveling carnivals worked.  It was so fascinating knowing that many incidents were based on real, actual events.

The most enlightening aspect of the story was the education I received about the hierarchy of employees within the circus.  From an outsider who has always been taught (but never believed it) that people in the circus where of lower class than others, I had no idea there were different ranks of people within the circus.  Life behind the scenes at the circus was crude and inhumane.  From the beginning the book was colorful with characters.  The transitioning between the past and the present with the main character was an interesting transition.I try to approach a book with an open mind and throw other opinions out the window.  I am pleased I have done this because the people that I know who have read this book have ranged from horrible to excellent.  I found this book entertaining and engrossing. It was never a book that I just could not put down, but I enjoyed read it.  Because the era in which the reference of the circus occurred the comparison of food lines and the great depression was evident.  Although the inhumane treatment of the people and animals undoubtedly occurred during this time period, it wasn't easy to read it.  Although the hierarchy of the class of people was evident within the circus, it was not unlike how society actually was during this time period.  The author clearly did research to solidly base the sad realities of the treatment of people and animals during the depression era.The author weaved a story with vivid characters and animal characters in a sympathetic and favorable light.  Sara Gruen's engaging \"Water for Elephants\" is an eminently American work, set in the depths of the Depression and featuring a broken-hearted young man whose unplanned existential leap of faith catapults him into a chaotic and unknown way of life. Jacob Jankowski discovers his untapped reservoir of courage, conviction and compassion, and in so doing, he, in every manner of the American definition of the word, emerges as a hero. \"Water for Elephants\" is a triumph -- of a writer fully in control of her craft, of a character resolute in his determination to discover life and of a depiction of ideas that truly embody our national character.After all of this being said, I am on the fence as to whether this book lives up to all the buzzes and even deserving of being made a movie.  There is nothing more satisfying than when you finish a book and you feel like you also were part of the adventure.

I thought Jacob's stories, both in the past and in the present, were extremely well written. I found his innocence and charm as a young man quite enchanting. Wouldn't it be grand if all young men were as courteous and as sweet as the young Jacob Jankowski? I also really liked the crotchety 90-year old Jacob, whose temper tantrums and emotional outbursts were most certainly justified. The loss of independence is something that we all fear, even more so when a person has lived a long and full life only to be left alone in a senior's home to die.I also thought Marlena's character was well-written. Divorce in the 1920s and 1930s was unheard of, and I can only imagine how awful it must have been for a woman to realize that she had to endure the rest of her life with someone she despised. I found myself wondering when she was going to make the decision to live for herself, rather than do what everyone expected her to do. Then again, she had already made that decision once by leaving her family, so I expected that she would come to the right decision at some point.As for Gruen's research into circus life during the Depression, I think that she did a fantastic job.

He lives in an assisted living facility, where he's forced to eat food he doesn't like and socialize with residents who are younger, but far worse off, than himself.  As he faces the realities of his advanced age and begins to deal with the ravages of time on his body, Jacob reflects on his younger years, when he worked as a veterinarian for a traveleing circus known as the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.  He joins the circus at 23, at the height of the Great Depression, right after his parents are killed in a car accident and right before he graduates from veterinary school.Most of WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is written in flashback, taking readers back to Jacob's beautiful and strange years with the circus during the 1920s and '30s.  While working for the circus, Jacob falls in love with two girls:  Marlena, the circus's star performer, and Rosie, a bull elephant no one else seems to want.  But there are complications, of course:  Marlena's husband, August, is the \"equestrian director\" of the circus--and he's also very possessive, obsessive, unpredictable, and cruel, not past beating both his wife and his animals if they don't adhere to his commands.  But Jacob's love for Marlena and Rosie transcends all this, and it will change his life; he has no way of knowing how much. Now, as an old man near the end of it all, trapped in a body he doesn't recognize, Jacob clings to his memories, to the vestiges of his younger years, as if they are a life raft.WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is the story of Jacob Jankowski's life--gritty, surreal, full of vibrance and love. In her third novel, Sara Gruen brings to life a dazzling cast of characters in a vivid landscape little-explored in contemporary fiction.  The world she has created for her readers is, well, otherworldly:  magical and strange and startlingly real.  Her Depression-era train circus resounds with authenticity; she borrows anecdotes from her research and uses circus slang to add a sense of immediacy to the experience. Her prose is simple and unpretentious, poetic in its own way.  Simply put:  WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is just lovely!I can't say anything bad about WATER FOR ELEPHANTS; I think it deserves every bit of praise it receives.  Jacob is such a compelling character, so utterly well-drawn.  His vibrancy as a young man jumps off the page at you; so does his frustration with being trapped in a withering body as an old man.  Gruen's tale moves back and forth in time seamlessly, and it's obvious how much she cares about her characters--even the non-human ones.  Her love story is impeccably researched, alternately heartbreaking and hopeful, romantic and violent. And the ending?--it's absolutely perfect.

But, with the hype and since I love to compare books to film, I figured I had to read it before I saw the film with Edward...ahem I mean Robert Pattinson and Reese Witherspoon. So, I did and immediately I was drawn in. I enjoyed how the narrative sliced between present day retirement home and past circus life. I appreciated the difficulties and heartaches of dealing with old age and time passing, with loneliness and loss of certain freedoms, with death. Of course, I also loved how the two main characters grew, fell in love, and fought against the obstacles to be together.It actually reminded me of Sparks' The Notebook. So, if you liked that and you like the circus, this is definitely the read for you. And for those animal rights activists, I didn't find the scenes of animal abuse that offensive. That topic is definitely a character in the book and certainly touched upon vividly BUT it's not accepted as just fact.

Ebeling \"ctlpareader\"", "helpful": [2, 2], "reviewText": "I could not help but notice that reading Sarah Gruen's Water For Elephants is very much like watching the movie \"Titanic.\"  First and foremost, each offers big historic pageantry, with a rousing \"you are there\" quality.  Each features two parallel narratives from the same protagonist, one in advanced age, one in a defining passage in young adulthood.  Both feature a romantic triangle involving a young woman who is a victim of her times stuck in a marriage or engagement to a cruel powerful man and the young man of no means who becomes her soulmate and savior.  Both send the young man to a fancy dress dinner in a borrowed tux. Both create insular worlds that are set apart from the rest of the earth, one by an ocean, the other by the train-bound peripatetic exotica of circus life, and within that insular world there is a class structure inspiring social commentary.  Both the Titanic creators and Gruen took admirable artistic risks in going to material that nobody else was treating and both did their homework on historical detail.Water For Elephants is about circus life in the early years of the Great Depression.  It successfully captures glimpses of the American experience and opens up the closed world of the circus that is at once a very dangerous place and a warm sanctuary.  Gruen does not spare the gritty reality of disregard for human and animal life.  She succeeds in creating a very delicately balanced community that can slide into disaster if shoved off balance.  Thinking on the living conditions she portrays, sometimes you have to ask, why would anyone stick with this mess?  For the narrator, Jacob Jankowski, it is love for animals, friends and the aforementioned girl.Water For Elephants is, like the Titanic, a large scale entertainment but when it comes down to it, there is no one line or character that is surprising (except perhaps for the elephant).  The book is well crafted but not artistic.  It may have been very different in the hands of John Steinbeck or EL Doctorow.  That said, Gruen gets points for following through on her inspiration and delivering a book that is very atmospheric and historically interesting, with some social commentary mixed in.This edition comes with a worthwhile interview with Gruen and a book club discussion guide that is more like a junior high English class test.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Big Hearted", "unixReviewTime": 1250640000, "reviewTime": "08 19, 2009"}

Jacob Jankowski is about to finish up his veterinary degree at Cornell University when he learns that his parents have been killed in a car crash. Stunned by this awful and sudden turn of events, Jacob completely blanks while taking his final exams. He walks out and wanders out of town in a complete daze, eventually jumping a train. It turns out he has jumped the circus train for the Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth.Jacob pretty much instantly falls for Marlena, one of the star performers. The only problem is that she is already married to August, the animal manager, who is, as we come to find out, a paranoid schizophrenic with erratic behavior problems. The story focuses on these three characters as the circus train makes its way around the country, performing in various cities. Along the way, the circus acquires an elephant, Jacob befriends his reluctant roommate, and tries to save an ailing friend from being tossed from the circus.This is a really interesting and moving book. It's really fascinating to read about daily circus life and how things worked. And it's a touching story about a smart elephant, a compassionate vet, and a forbidden love. I do wish there had been some more charater development for Rosie the elephant, though. Also, the story is told in retrospect, from a present-day Jacob who is now in his 90s. Every few chapters, the story skips back to present day, and the nursing home-bound narrator. I felt the story would have worked a lot better if it had just stuck to the circus part of the story.

I flew straight through it in just a few intense sessions, eyes locked to the page over an hour at a time.  Couple of quick book comparisons immediately come to mind.  First, I'm reminded of the great line near the beginning of \"Life of Pi\", that informs the reader that they are about to hear a story that will make them believe in God.  I wrapped myself around that line and read in hopes of the book keeping that promise.  It's a bold promise, so I reward the book for its effort, but I'm not sure it lead to any true converts.  We get a similar sentiment in the beginning of \"Water for Elephants.\"  Jacob pulls us in by insinuating that he's about to tell us a secret he's kept for over seventy years.  Again, I found myself lured into the book's \"Big Top\" to find that secret.  And much like an old-world carnival, I found my main attraction and enjoyed all of the book's turns and sideshows.Another book comparison that comes to mind is with \"Iron Weed,\" a Pulitzer Prize winner in the eighties.  Like, \"Iron Weed,\" this book does really an excellent job of submersing you in the feel and sense of being flat broke and in dire straights, trying to negotiate survival during the Great Depression. During a long stretch inside the world the book creates, I could literally feel the dust and dirt being kicked up by the roustabouts and workers, as the tents went up.  Gruen took my into those crammed, dirty box cars, and murky late-night binges.  I was there.One more favorite from the book.  The author somehow manages to make the internal world of a ninety or ninety-three year old man, trapped and forgotten in a nursing home, just about as interesting as the glitz and glamor of the show and the drama it unfolds.  That's no easy feat, but she does it well.  I was left thinking about aging, long after I had let go of the circus.  Jacob's thoughts about how senility sort of creeps in and his explanations of his two worlds, and no longer being sure where one ends and the other begins, stayed with me.

However, the backbone of the story seems to be a sort of iconoclasm. The Sterling images of the circus often inculcated in us during childhood are challenged by images of violence, animal cruelty, and graphic sexuality. However, the fact that this book unearths the dark side of the early twentieth century circus speaks less to its quality than to the fact that our society all too often allows commercialism and popular mythology to shape our images of the past. Simply challenging false notions held by society contributes very little to the value of a story like this one. In the end, the tone of the book takes on moods which can change violently from the darkly cynical to the unrealistically optimistic (the ending of the book feels impossible, illegal, and unsafe). Sentimentality, rather than a meaningful exploration of human emotion, dominates the scenes of the assisted living facility, although as noted above, the fact that those scenes also bring to light the continuing need for respect to the elderly does serve to redeem them to a decent extent.The story is, on some level, a \"forbidden romance\", and on this level, it has many failings. The rapidity with which Marlena falls for Jacob seems more indicative of a woman torn by the violent nature of her relationship than a woman in anything approaching love. The way in which August is killed seems to do nothing but Grant a legitimacy to the relationship via Pacidermis ex Machina, and to tie up loose ends.All in all, this isn't an awful book, but it seems to be the type of story commonly found in book discussion groups for all of two months before being rapidly forgotten. There is no real draw, beyond a handful of tense and well-written moments in the last quarter of the story.For the Kindle edition, images work surprisingly well, and I have no real complaints about formatting.", "overall": 2.0, "summary": "A New York Times Bestseller Unlikely To Stand The Test Of Time", "unixReviewTime": 1359158400, "reviewTime": "01 26, 2013"}

It's rare that I read a novel and become so engulfed with the story, but from the first page, I was hooked. The way in which Gruen has the protagonist of the story, Jacob Jankowski, switch back and forth between his 22-year-old self and present day 90 (or 93) year-old self is both creative and effective in capturing her readers. Every single scene has intensity and vibrancy. The juxtaposition of the elderly Jankowski and the young circus worker Jankowski posed a humorous yet almost sad setting for the story. Readers would be crazy not to fall in love with his character.Though fiction, the novel represents the lives of circus workers back in the 1920's and 1930's and gives insight to the gruesome conditions the men had to live in, and the constant struggles that they faced everyday. Each chapter begins with a photograph derived from circuses back from the time Jankowski would have worked. The photos truly show the lives that these men led and let readers see not only imagine how things were. Though the historical value of the novel was fascinating, the forbidden but passionate relationship between Marlena and Jacob was the most captivating portion. The constant secrecy from August and the fear of being revealed created an incredible emotional reaction for me.The corruption of the novel and the intensity of the characters made this novel a hard one to dislike. In my opinion, it has to be one of the best books written in the past few years.

However, he does remember a very interesting part of his life.  It comes about one day when the news that a circus is in town and one of Jacob's fellow nursing home inmates brags about having worked at a circus and giving water to the elephants.  Jacob knows the old man is full of it.  After all, Jacob once worked at a circus.  Rewind seventy-something years, to the 1930s, amid the Great Depression.  Jacob is twenty-three, just weeks away from getting his degree in Cornwall University to become a certified veterinarian.  Then he receives the news that his parents died in a terrible accident.  He also discovers that they had no money -- they had invested every last penny on Jacob's Ivy League education.  Distraught, Jacob runs away.  By accident, he ends up on a train, destination unknown.  He discovers that the train is actually one that carries a traveling circus.  One thing leads to another, and he ends up working as a sort of unofficial caretaker for the animals.  He meets August and his wife Marlena.  Jacob learns many secrets to life as a circus performer and worker, meets lots of interesting people, and encounters some very unsavory things.  August, for instance, is a very unstable, unpredictable person.  He is abusive to the animals and insufferable one moment, and completely charming and obliging the next.  The way he treats the animals, especially Rosie, the new performing elephant, makes Jacob sick, but he can't do anything about it.  The Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth has its awful moments, but things get worse for Jacob when he falls in love with the beautiful Marlena...I like the way Water for Elephants changes from Jacob's present-day narrative as a cynical old man with early signs of dementia to his days as a nave young man and his struggles with wanting to fit into the Benzini Brothers and wanting to lose his virginity.  The way his voice and narrative change is clear and precise and you get drawn into this unique and at times quirky novel.  The backdrop of the Depression is wonderful and believable.  The secondary characters are compelling, especially Walter, August, Uncle Al and Marlena.  August is a horrible person, and the scenes centered on his abuse toward Rosie the elephant are indeed sickening.  It's a good thing Gruen spares us from too much information in terms of the actual abuse.  Rosie sounds adorable and I loved it when she was in the scenes.  I very much enjoyed Water for Elephants.  It's very moving and entertaining.  No wonder it became a #1 New York Times bestseller!

It was strongly recommended to me by several people who said it was \"a great story\" so I was expecting something that would truly captivate me and pull me in. For me, it simply fell short.I think that a tremendous amount of time and effort went into the research involved for this book and that should not go unnoticed. If you're looking for a book that clearly depicts the Great Depression and/or circus life during that time period - by all means you should pick up the book. I do not know a tremendous amount about that time period to tell you if it was fully accurate, but I feel that it did give me a pretty good picture of what circus life would be like in that era. The photographs installed at the beginning of each chapter also did a great job connecting the story with the reality of traveling circuses of the time. The language probably could have corresponded a bit more, but in terms of the spirit and energy of the book versus the time period in which it takes place, I think it was pretty spot on.However, I really had trouble connecting with the characters. They simply did not seem like well-rounded, real people to me. I understand that the characters should be eccentric considering they are individuals traveling with a circus, but not to the point where they should seem artificial. Their emotional reactions to various tumultuous situations seemed unrealistic - based on having experienced similar situations in my life. The psychological repercussions would have been huge for a lot of the major conflicts that occur in the book - especially during the time of the Great Depression - but I did not feel the degree of inner struggle within the characters was well represented throughout the story. The characters would get sad or angry, but they seemed to sedate their feelings pretty darn quick.The depiction of the main character in his old age, however, seemed more realistic to me. I thought the scenes in the nursing home were very well done and true to life. The characters in these parts also seemed more believable to me. However, I was pretty disappointed in the ending. It seemed contrived. I will not get into it too deeply, however, so as not to spoil the story.I genuinely feel that Sara Gruen is a great author and did a good job with the book, I just feel that the character development was lacking. In terms of painting a picture of the environment though, she did a fantastic job and it's a book worth reading, if only for the descriptive element of it.

Instead it perpetuates the romantic ideals set forth by Harlequin and its ilk -- heights that no three-dimensional male can ever reach. (No wonder it was a word-of-mouth bestseller.)This is shown most strikingly through Gruen's protagonist, Jacob Jankowski. He does not talk, think, or act like any (straight) man I have ever met. The purpose he serves, it seems, is to stand in for a lot of women's idea of what a man should be. When a man looks at another man and calls him \"unshaven\" with the implication that what he really means is \"unclean,\" you know you're nowhere near reality. This type of man lives only in fiction.Gruen even makes Jacob a virgin (though old enough to have a degree from veterinary school) so that when he and the female lead finally make it to the bed (which is inevitable in this world), it more closely match the unspoken wishes of her audience.(Now, understand, men's fiction is no better from the woman's point of view, with the hero more often than not bedding the female lead, who then conveniently dies so he can have access to a series of new women without guilt for the expense of a succession of prostitutes. I'm not saying it's any better, but at least it's marketed to men and not a general audience.)Gruen relies so much on stereotypes from romance novels (or even just their covers) and \"chick flicks\" that none of the characters in Water for Elephants ever feels like a real human being but simply an archetype playing its part in her story. The writing flows nicely, and the story is somewhat interesting if you don't mind melodrama.Also, Gruen manages to humanize people who have previously been seen as freaks, but this was all for nought when I never believed that the narrator was telling me the truth about his gender. I actually kept waiting for that to be a \"twist\" in the story, and in fact was disappointed when it never came.Plus, if a man were really telling the story, he would undoubtedly have recognized the sophomoric unintentional hilarity in the following passage: Teams of men are ... raising enormous poles.... I pass a group of ten throwing their combined weight against a single rope as a man off to the side chants, \"Pull it, shake it, break it! Again--pull it, shake it, break it!

When both of his parents die in a car accident, Jacob is so torn up, he runs away in the middle of his final exams and joins up on a circus train, the Benzini Brothers' Most Spectacular Show on Earth. His life in the Depression era on a traveling circus are intercut with the present day, 90-something year old Jacob reminiscing about the past and dealing with one of the most difficult obstacles: life.I Liked:With the movie due to appear in theaters soon and the recommendation from a friend, I decided to hunt down an audiobook and listen. And, in short, am I glad.Before I started reading, I thought (based on either the blurb on the back cover and the movie trailer) that the book was a love story dressed up in circus costumes in the vein of James Cameron's \"Titanic\". Poor boy meets wealthy attached (married) girl, both fall in love, blah, blah, blah. Throw in some random animals, circus acts, and there you go.I was pleasantly surprised to see that this wasn't the case. The characters were beautifully drawn and real, from our protagonist and narrator, Jacob, to his bunkmate, Kinko/Walter, to our love interest, Marlena, to our antagonist, Big Al. The story focuses more on the circus life than on the love between Marlena and Jacob. The setting was beautiful and intricate, the ambience was spectacular and grotesque (sometimes at the same time!), and I truly felt transported back into the past. Not to mention, there were many tearjerker moments--real, emotional moments, not those written just to elicit a pornographic emotional response.Jacob was a good narrator. I felt his pain as his parents died, I understood his awe at Rosie, I felt his disgust at August's disgusting behavior. But my favorite character was Marlena, and I can definitely see why Reese Witherspoon was cast as her. She is spunky, fun, mature, and spirited. My heart broke hearing how her family abandoned her just because she married a Jew (she was Catholic), and I hated how August treated her. Walter was also another great character. It was terrible how his mother basically sold him to the circus just because of his dwarfism. And the scene where he almost loses Queenie really brought home how alone and lonely this poor guy was.So many novels these days seem to be window dressing for a love story, but this novel isn't one of them. Sure, a cornerstone of the novel is about Marlena and Jacob, but there is much more going on. A man's journey into coping with death. The horrors of the circus. How hard life was back in the Depression. Escapism. The trials of growing older. The need to belong. The story deftly wove back and forth between younger and older Jacob, and I found myself interested in BOTH sides, not just one or the other.I Didn't Like:In places, the novel is very graphic. I didn't care for when Jacob barged in on someone AHEMing or hearing about the two ladies AHEMing Jacob.I would have liked to have seen a little more of the acts that went on in the circus, though I suppose those would work better in a visual medium.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:A few f-bombs, amongst milder profanities.Jacob is interested in losing his virginity. While drunk, two women try to perform sexual acts on him, but Jacob vomits on one. Two characters make love; \"self love\" is shown once or twice.The story opens with a character about to be impaled. Camel is crippled because of his drinking. August is abusive to his animals and to others. Workers have been thrown off the train, a practice called \"red lighting\".Overall:This is an impressive book, one that totally bucked all my prejudices and preconceived notions. It was able to do what a lot of books can't: make me care about the characters and take me to another \"world\". I only hope that the movie, when it comes out, can do it justice. Highly recommended.Brought to you by:*C.S.

This is perhaps the most extraordinary novel I've read in literally years, from an author with truly AWESOME talent.  Generally, I read almost nothing but mystery novels...and ones with \"hard-bitten\" heroes, at that...not even a hint of anything sniveling.  I'm just not a touchie-feelie kind of girl.  So if a feel-good book like this can affect me so enormously, just think what it'll do for those of you who like this kind of stuff!  Only partly joking here; but truly, this is one magnificent work of literary art.  Inside glimpses of life in a 1930's circus are so intimately written and ring so true, that it's hard to believe Ms. Gruen isn't 90 years old, writing memoirs.  Each character is so artfully rendered that you care, and care deeply!, about every single one of them.  You love them or hate them, with equal measures of intensity.  Add the super special treat at the beginning of most chapters of real photos from these old circuses, and you have just a jewel of a book.  Obviously, I'm drooling all over myself in this review, but I can't recommend it strongly enough, to everyone, no matter your preferences in reading material.  I took a chance and am SO glad I did.  Oh, and Ms. Gruen has a sense of humor too!  There are parts of the book where I guarantee you will be unable to hold back from a big belly laugh, right out loud.  Please, get this book.  You will NOT regret a single minute of reading time.  I fully intend to go now and buy every book she's every written, hoping for another glimpse of her genius.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Absolutely MAGNIFICENT", "unixReviewTime": 1190592000, "reviewTime": "09 24, 2007"}
