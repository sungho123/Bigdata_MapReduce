Since then I've read every other Paullina Simons book I can get my hands on. If I absolutely had to compare it to another Simons novel I'd compare it to Tully in that it's very much a character study, but really it's not all that similar. It's new literary ground for Simons.Basically the plot deals with a 24 year old New Yorker named Lily, who sort of floats through life. She's broke and afraid to commit to anything. Suddenly several unexpected events occur at once and the ever superstitous Lily is shaken to the core: Her best friend and roommate, Amy, goes missing suddenly, and Lily wins $18 million in the lottery. Lily is terrified to cash in her ticket because she's waiting for her luck to  run out (which she thinks will happen by something bad happening to Amy). But Lily can't escape her fate even by not cashing in her ticket. She's diagnosed with an extrememly rare form of leukemia. On the verge of death Lily suddenly realises that she can't bear to leave the life that she's been afraid to commit to. She's fallen in love with Spencer, the detective in charge of looking for Amy. Meanwhile Spencer has uncovered disturbing evidence linking Amy's disappearance to Lily's brother Andrew, and the consequences of a case from his past have come back to haunt him (Simons fans might remember Spencer from the book \"Red Leaves\").The plot sounds confusing but that's because the book seems to defy genre- it's a love story (Lily and Spencer), a mystery (what happened to Amy? How was Andrew involved?) a family drama (wait to you read about Lily's family!) and the story of Lily coming to find herself as she fights for her life, and tries to fight Spencer's demons so that he can share that life with her. Anyway, I recommend it to all of Simon's fans, and I can't wait to read her next book.", "overall": 5.0, "summary": "Once Again Paullina Simons Delivers", "unixReviewTime": 1157500800, "reviewTime": "09 6, 2006"}

What follows is the unraveling of Lily's life - her every assumption about who she is, who her family is, what she deserves in life and the delicate balance of self belief vs what the universe has in store for her. Lily battles cancer, tears down some relationships and builds others. At heart this really is a love story - the love story both of Lily and herself and Lily and the man in her life. All of the characters in this book are deeply flawed in one way or another, and not all of the stories end happily. I like that. Life doesn't always offer up happy endings and I don't like books that pretend they do. Sure, sometimes it is okay (and some things certainly are okay for Lily in this book) but some things just aren't. The language of this book is simple and evocative. The pages fly by as you are immersed in Lily's world.My only complaint would be that sometimes the author went a bit too far - Lily wins the lottery, Lily is an incredible painter who sells all of her paintings and is offered thousands of dollars for them, someone in the story is in a convent in Mexico after a psychotic break, someone cut off a vital part of their anatomy in a drug fulled frenzy.

These stories compare unfavorably to Conan Doyle&#8217;s stories. They are good but not great. Most of Christie&#8217;s work were novels not short stories.

{"reviewerID": "A1S26JXPQKFVPI", "asin": "0007119267", "reviewerName": "Alexander Arsov", "helpful": [1, 2], "reviewText": "I am among the spoiled ones who came to this book through the 1982 movie starring Peter Ustinov as the legendary Belgian sleuth. So I got curious to read something by the Queen of Crime and see if she is really that good on paper. Well, yes and no, but definitely more \"yes\" than \"no\". I will be reading her again. Now what about this \"Evil Under the Sun\".In a way, knowing pretty well the murder plan, for the screenplay is fairly close to the original, increased my appreciation for the meticulous preparation of the clues - including the misleading ones. I would never have guessed the denouement anyway.The plot is simple enough on the surface. You know the drill. Soon after the first page - but late enough to raise suspicions against several of the characters - the most auspicious event in every crime mystery happens: somebody is murdered. After long and ingenious investigation by the locale police, but with an indispensable brain input from Hercule Poirot, a mighty conspiracy is uncovered, the murderer is caught, his guilt proven beyond doubt, and all of the rest live happily ever after.The whole thing is perfectly preposterous and totally incredible. And that should be expected, of course. Agatha Christie would have no truck with nonsensical cliches like \"life is stranger than fiction\". Were she not a lady of impeccable manners, she might have exclaimed something like: ''Balls!'' The important thing is that the book is stupendously readable and highly entertaining. The picturesque setting of a small hotel on a private island full of lovely coves and beaches only increases its value as an exercise in sheer escapism. Ridiculous as it is, the plot is masterfully revealed and expertly paced.The omniscient Wikipedia, the closest approximation to God on Earth, tells me that Agatha Christie was also a celebrated dramatist and that her most successful play, \"The Mousetrap\", is the longest running in history. Apparently it has never been quite off-stage since its premiere in 1952! \"Evil Under the Sun\" provides an ample evidence of the authoress' flair for drama. The novel is virtually a play: it consists almost exclusively of dialogue; the pieces of third-person narrative inserted in between are shorter than the stage directions in Shaw's plays. And the dialogue is extremely accomplished indeed: pointed, dramatically relevant, always in character, even with some food for thought about human nature now and then.With the possible exception of Hercule Poirot (to be dissected in a minute), all characters are entirely one-dimensional; only very occasionally a hint of second dimension is to be glimpsed; a third one is of course out of the question. The important point to appreciate is the diversity and especially the individuality of the characters. Quite a colourful bunch they are!We have one Reverend Lane, a religious fanatic obsessed with evil, especially under feminine disguise. There's the quiet, reserved and well-off Captain Marshall who just happens to be husband of the victim (and the deep waters... you know); and his daughter, Linda, granted the vulnerability of her tender age, is rather wacky creature, not terribly fond of her stepmother. Then there is Major Barrie, a stuffy old bore with an incredible propensity for telling tedious stories from his Indian years. Mr Blatt is a very rich and very talkative fellow who never misses the opportunity to tell you that his money is as good as anybody else's and especially what a dud this remote hotel full of dullards really is. Mr Blatt's amateur analysis of the suspects, given to the police with his usual and blunt frankness, is colourful enough to deserve quotation:\"As I said before, it wasn't me! No such luck! Let me see, couldn't have been Gardener - his wife keeps far too sharp an eye on him! That old ass Barrie? Rot! And it would hardly be the parson. Although, mind you, I've seen his Reverence watching her a good bit. All holy disapproval, but perhaps an eye for the contours all the same! Eh? Lot of hypocrites, most parsons. Did you read that case last month? Parson and the churchwarden's daughter! Bit of an eye-opener.\"Amusing chap, this Mr Blatt, isn't he? Then we have two lovely couples. The Gardeners are Americans of uncertain age, but probably in the senior range; she talks nineteen to dozen, his vocabulary is largely reduced to \"Yes, darling\". The Redferns are much younger and conspicuously British; Patrick is dashing and handsome to the extreme, with physique that combines the best of Apollo and Hercules; Christine is \"pretty in washed-out way\" and obviously in the possession of impressive amount of brains. And speaking of brains, we have two remarkable women more: Miss Brewster, always cool-headed about the tragedy, and Rosamund Darnley, the epitome of the emancipated woman from the late 1930s, own fashion business, pots of money and all.Like I said, a really colourful bunch. So who murdered the \"poor, foolish, beautiful\" Arlena Marshall? And how exactly was such virtuoso crime performance planned and executed? Tough, eh! No more spoilers (for now).In the \"stage directions\" there often are gems of concise description that start from the outside and reveal the inner worlds of the characters in a most compelling way. They usually employ excessively formal style to a great comic effect. To take but one memorable example:\"On the slightly apoplectic countenance of Major Barrie various emotions seemed contending for mastery. He was endeavoruing to look properly horrified but could not subdue a kind of shamefaced gusto.\"Hercule Poirot, though fussy and pedantic, is a fellow of considerable charm. His elaborate cordiality is quite endearing: ''Will you permit me to be impertinent, Mademoiselle?'' His candour and bluntness, especially when questioning suspects, are remarkable enough to embarrass his English colleagues. If you mistake him for French, perhaps misled by his delicious accent, he would reply with unmistakable coldness ''I am NOT French'', and if you suggest the classic ''crime of passion'' he would caress his well-groomed moustache, inspect reflectively the roof, and murmur ''There are many passions.''He is a cool customer all right. People lying on the beach sunbathing? Why, they remind one of bodies in the morgue: arranged on the slabs, like butcher's meat! However, Poirot's comment (his emphasis) that ''Today everything is STANDARDIZED'' is frightfully prescient. He is always ready with an answer, usually a chilling one. Isn't such a lovely beach resort a most unlikely place for a crime? But you forget, madam, that there is everywhere evil under the sun. And you also forget that nobody has to account for being on holiday - which in fact makes beach resorts an even more likely place for murder than the cities. Smart bloke, no argument about that.Above all, Poirot is a patient observer and a shrewd judge of human nature. He is like a sponge for multifarious impressions and minute details: the real sleuth never knows what might turn out to be of critical importance later. He formulates and classifies with the precision and impartiality of a computer program. One could introduce him as the newest software for generating penetrating psychological profiles of real people on the basis of the shortest acquaintance; say, ''Poirot v5.1''. The pithy summaries of the characters, including the victim, he gives to the guys from the police in the beginning of the investigation are fabulously accurate.The most fascinating thing about Hercule Poirot is that he is in some ways a very unpleasant character. To begin with, he is a pathological eavesdropper. And I don't mean casual overhearing of a few words from the next table. I mean following people to most unlikely places with the sole intention of aural prying into their private matters. He has no scruples about that and if you ask him why, he would reply that it was a question of murder. Of course you object that at the time the murder in question hadn't been committed yet, but Poirot is imperturbable: he could already sense it. But why on earth didn't you prevent it then? Well, Monsieur, when somebody is determined to commit murder, it is very difficult to prevent it. Personally, I think it was inevitable.Sometimes I wonder if Poirot wouldn't prevent a crime even if he could, simply because it would devoid him of the opportunity to solve the riddle, expose the murderer and no doubt satisfy his considerable vanity. He is not heartless or cruel or anything like that. He is certainly susceptible to intellectual feminine company (e.g. Rosamund), though spectacularly impervious to sensual one (e.g. Arlena), and he is not unsympathetic to the disturbed mental state of the young Linda Marshall. And yet, Poirot's cold and dispassionate observations often border on inhumanity.In short, Hercule Poirot is a curious, ambiguous, charming and disturbing character. Not a bad achievement for a crime mystery.Leaving aside usual drawbacks such as idiotic plots, flat characters and clipped writing - inherent in genre itself and therefore no real shortcomings - there are several aspects in which \"Evil Under the Sun\" does leave something to be desired. For one thing, I wish Agatha Christie had spent more time dwelling on Poirot's psychological make-up. This is a golden mine of characterization that is left somewhat undeveloped. Maybe she has better fleshed out the elusive Belgian in some of her other novels.Also, the book is a little uneven. There are some parts, such as the interrogation of the hotel guests immediately after the murder, which tend to be monotonous and repetitive. Even the best dialogue can't save these from being a bit dull. By the way, considering Christie's remarkable flair for writing natural yet precise dialogue, there are far too many \"he said\" and \"she said\" that should have been cut; sometimes such parasites can be quite annoying. Last and least, some of the subplots - I can't tell you which ones without spoiling - look a trifle too far-fetched. It's difficult to believe that both the police and Poirot take them seriously, and they look like mere pastiche.And there is another common trap in this type of literature that the Queen of Crime doesn't quite escape. This is the ISV syndrome, that is ''Insufficient Sympathy for the Victim''. Arlena is such a fabulous incarnation of bitchiness, everybody is so convinced she ''had it coming'', ''asked for it'' or ''deserved it'', that it's rather easy to actually sympathize with her killer, namely the subject who ''does her in'', ''put her out'', etc. lovely idioms. Since the latter is inevitably discovered in the end, much to his/her trouble, this is a most undesirable side effect. Only in the very end of the book, much too late, does Poirot himself, no less, manage to suggest that the likes of Arlena should indeed be sorry about. In other words, the proverbial femme fatale normally leads a life that is equally fatal, if not more so, for her as it is for the men she makes mad. And her ''fatal attraction'', apart from obvious physical gifts, rests (if only unconsciously) on profound loneliness.All in all, for sheer, one-off, unabashed, escapist fun, Evil Under the Sun is an excellent choice. There is some room for improvement and I wonder if Agatha Christie does improve in some of her other famous ''Poirot mysteries''. I don't really believe she does, but I intend to find out all the same. Even if she doesn't, Poirot's mind and method are still worth the time, and so are those marvelously suggestive secondary characters.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Great, unabashed, unalloyed, unputdownable entertainment", "unixReviewTime": 1351900800, "reviewTime": "11 3, 2012"}

While on holiday at the Jolly Roger Hotel on England's South Coast, she openly cavorts with Patrick Redfern while her husband and his wife watch helplessly.  Tragedy is inevitable and few are surprised when Arlena is murdered.What sets Christie apart from other mystery writers is the wonderful skill she exhibits with characterizations.  This novel, one of her best in my opinion, is complete with many well-developed ones which make for a believable crime.

A major (though false) lead appeared halfway through, and while there was speculation as to how it tied in to everything, there was no real resolution to it.  And when the revelation happened, it was done in a sort of offbeat way, and the last chapter was just a giant, lengthy explanation from Poirot as to what actually happened and why, which was interesting...until the last page and a half were taken up by a conversation between two characters that really could have been a lot shorter.Why am I even breaking down the book into the reasons I didn't like it??

I just read a crumbling Dell edition from the late 1950s/early 1960s (the price on the cover is 45), and the table of contents is consistent with other editions under this title.  Together, this particular set of stories collects early markers of Poirot style and themes.  It would be ripe for a critical introduction, because the stories are apparently plunked unedited from their original appearance.  The novella length title story, \"The Under Dog,\" is narrated in the 3rd person, but the rest are narrated by Poirot's friend Hastings--if you are not familiar with other Poirot stories narrated by Hastings, you may be at a loss for wondering to whom the voice belongs at first.  There is a pause about three-quarters of the way through in one of the stories with an insert signed \"the editors\" that suggests the reader stop right there, formulate a guess as to the solution and then read on to see if it pans out.  None of the others do that, so I'm assuming that is a leftover device from the magazine in which it originally appeared.The stories are mostly fine, vintage Christie. She was obviously enjoying herself. I did not fully appreciate the debt Christie owed Sherlock Holmes for Hercule Poirot until I read this group together, the confident, eccentric detective and the play along friend/narrator.

Is the killer a jealous husband, a jealous wife, an unstable step-daughter--or is it connected with the occult, a possible serial killer, an unknown blackmailer, or a member of a drug distribution ring?  The plot complications come tumbling one on top of another, but fortunately for the innocent the island resort is host to a private detective on vacation: the celebrated Hercule Poirot.The novel is particularly memorable for the way in which Christie requires readers to interpret the personality of her characters... and in the process leads you completely astray. Long time fans may recognize the plot device on which the solution rests, for Christie used it earlier in a number of celebrated short stories and would repeat it in a number of later works as well--but to give the Queen of Crime her due, she so neatly works the story that even the most astute reader is unlikely to arrive at the full truth until Poirot deigns to expose it.

Amongst the hotel guests are an American couple, a retired priest, a longwinded army chap, a spinster, a female friend of Captain Marshall and Hercule Poirot.One bright sunny morning, Arlena is found dead, strangled at Pixy Cove. Hercule Poirot and the local police are called in to investigate the matter. Could the jealous husband have murdered her or perhaps it was the long suffering wife. Could it be that Arlena was blackmailed by some unscrupulous cad? Could she have stumbled across a smuggling operation at the cove? Hercule Poirot fits the pieces of the puzzle together. Amongst the clues are a pair of scissors found at the scene of the crime, pieces of a green calendar and wax in the fire grate in one of the guests rooms, an empty bottle thrown out of a window, the sound of bath water draining from a tub at midday.This is classic Agatha Christie at her best. The scene is set, the characters introduced, the clues planted. As always the reader wil be left wondering right up to the end of the book as to who comitted the crime. As with all Agatha Christie novels, there are as many twists and turn in the plot to keep you changing your mind as to the identity of the killer. Agatha Christie is always a joy to read and this is no exception.Lea Ling Tsang", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Classic Agatha Christie Whodunnit!", "unixReviewTime": 1096934400, "reviewTime": "10 5, 2004"}

This was my first, and I can certainly see why Christie is the world's most-published novelist. If there's one thing Christie can do, it's tell a good story. And that's precisely what she does in Evil under the Sun. I can see why readers find Christie's work compelling; she draws her readers in quickly, with a large cast of thickly-described characters and a vivid sense of surroundings. Evil under the Sun brings us to a seaside resort, where a group of holiday-makers, including Christie's famous Inspector Poirot, find themselves attempting to deal with a broad range of personalities. Likely the most abrasive of all is the beautiful and capricious socialite Arlena Marshall. When she turns up dead in a remote part of the beach, it becomes Poirot's calling to determine her murderer. The resort's island location makes it unlikely that anyone outside the hotel could be responsible. Thus, Poirot must discover the murderer in his midst. Everyone, it seems, had a motive. Yet everyone too had an alibi. The answer turns out to be far more complicated than anyone had anticipated. Christie's gift is clearly to tell a gripping story. While there are no great lessons on morality or statements on the human condition within this it is certainly entertaining, enjoyable, and just a bit scary.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "A good story", "unixReviewTime": 1223337600, "reviewTime": "10 7, 2008"}

The book makes no allusion to the war, no doubt by design as the last thing Britons wanted from their escapist reading was a reminder that there was a war on.Instead, we get a highly engaging murder mystery with a set of colorful characters, an interesting setting (a resort hotel located on a promontory that is cut off from the mainland at high tide) and a fully engaged Hercule Poirot, who just happens to be vacationing there. Unlike in her most recent previous Poirot books (Hercule Poirot's Christmas, Sad Cypress, The Patriotic Murders), author Agatha Christie makes her detective a main character right off the bat in this one instead of bringing him in after the murder had been committed.There is much less time spent at the start filling in the back stories of the supporting characters than in the previous books and no real romantic subplot. What is familiar is the idea of having sympathetic characters as suspects and an unsympathetic character as the murder victim. Christie had played with this dynamic in Appointment With Death and Death on the Nile several years earlier.It is quite effective here as we feel our emotions put through the ringer as clues emerge and red herrings are introduced. You find yourself constantly thinking, \"Oh no, I hope it isn't him/her who did it!\" The resolution is rather convoluted and a bit \"unfair\" in that it introduces new evidence to support the conclusion. Still, there is a very active Poirot and that is always supremely entertaining.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Poirot fully engaged", "unixReviewTime": 1377043200, "reviewTime": "08 21, 2013"}

Worley", "helpful": [23, 26], "reviewText": "The stories herein first appeared in various magazines; they're sorted here by original publication date rather than order of appearance in the book.\"The King of Clubs\" - (March, 1923) Valerie Saintclair, the famous dancer, has just been all over the papers, having discovered the murdered body of Henry Reedburn. Prince Paul of Maurania comes to Poirot, since he proposes to marry her, saying (in one breath), \"We are living now in more enlightened days, free from the old caste prejudices,\" while *also* saying that 1) it'll be a morganatic marriage (i.e., the children would be out of the succession), and 2) it doesn't matter because she's actually the daughter of a Russian grand duchess. (He says that she's bound to secrecy, but has let him guess that much).In other words, Prince Paul is a pompous idiot, who half-suspects Mlle. Saintclair of murdering Reedburn, based on her reaction to a fortuneteller's card reading turning up the king of clubs (a fearsome man holding her in his power), and he's hiring Poirot to find out what really happened. (If you have even a passing acquaintance with that method of fortunetelling, incidentally, don't let Christie's misuse of terms distract you from the facts of the case.)\"The Affair at the Victory Ball\" - (March, 1923) The Victory in question was the end of WW I. Young Lord Cronshaw and his fiancee Coco Courtenay attended the ball with several friends, all dressed as characters from the Italian Comedy, he as Harlequin, she as Columbine, and both died that night, she from a cocaine overdose in her flat, he with a table knife through his heart at the ball. (There are no Quin or Satterthwaite appearances, incidentally, despite the Harlequin references.) This story is that rare animal, a Christie creation that pauses and offers a challenge to the reader before revealing the solution.\"The Plymouth Express\" - (April, 1923) Flossie Halliday Carrington, soon-to-be ex wife of the Honourable Rupert Carrington, who married her for her father's money, was found murdered during a train journey, and her father has hired Poirot to find the killer (he wants his own man, not just the usual police investigation). This story strongly resembles _The Mystery of the Blue Train_, but the actual puzzle (i.e. who/how/why) isn't really the same, so don't be misled.\"The Market Basing Mystery\" - (October, 1923) Japp, Hastings, and Poirot are spending a weekend on holiday in Market Basing, and Japp is called in on a local locked-room mystery. This case bears a striking resemblance to another locked-room case, \"Murder in the Mews\"; see the book of the same name if you'd like to compare them.\"The Adventure of the Clapham Cook\" - (November, 1923) The cook in question, a middle-aged, respectable, plain woman working in a private household, quit without a word of warning; no formal complaints, no quarrel with the only other staff member. She just went out on her day off, never came back, and sent for her trunk (not even formally resigning). Her now-ex employer wants to find her, since it's *very* fishy, and good cooks are hard to come by.\"The Cornish Mystery\" -  (November, 1923) Mrs. Pengelley, a plain, ordinary woman of about 50, is afraid that her husband is slowly poisoning her - whenever he's away, her 'gastritis' gets better, the weed-killer is running low, and he's got a young blond hussy of an assistant. (He's the one with the money, though.) Poirot finds it interesting, partly because of Mrs. Pengelley's unusual reaction to her suspicions; but his arrival in Cornwall the day after she hires him, it turns out, is too late. The general framework of the story resembles at least 3 other Christie stories, one quite strongly (each for a different detective), but they differ in detail, so don't jump to any conclusions.\"The Submarine Plans\" - (November, 1923) - Same story as \"The Incredible Theft\" in _Dead Man's Mirror_; Christie did a little revision, but not enough to make it a different story.\"The Lemesurier Inheritance\" - (December, 1923) This case begins with a chance meeting during WWI between Poirot, Hastings, and Captain Vincent Lemesurier, on the night that Vincent receives word that his father is dying of injuries received in a riding accident. The family has a tradition, dating back to the middle ages, that no eldest son of a Lemesurier will ever inherit - and sure enough, Vincent takes a misstep on the train home, and the next in line inherits. Several times over the next few years, one member or another of the family dies: an allergic reaction to a wasp sting here, a shooting accident there. Finally, Mrs. Hugo Lemesurier comes to Poirot and Hastings: her husband, now terminally ill, has a morbid belief that his eldest son won't outlive him. For her part, she doesn't believe that a curse could saw through a vine under the nursery window that the kids like to climb out of. Compare this one with \"The Adventure of the Egyptian Tomb\" in _Poirot Investigates_, as 2 examples of Poirot's theory of the power of superstition.\"The Under Dog\" - (October, 1926) Mercifully, in my opinion, we don't have Hastings narrating this one, although he relates all the other stories in this volume. Hot-tempered Sir Reuben Astwell has been found murdered in his country home, his head smashed with a club in his own study. (Some of the family have travelled in Africa; the club was part of the decor). His fortune is divided between Lady Astwell and his ineffectual nephew Charles. Charles, a failure in business who drinks, is the prime suspect, but Lady Astwell insists that Owen Trefusis, the browbeaten little secretary, did it, and engages Poirot to uncover the truth.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Poirot's early career in London", "unixReviewTime": 1016841600, "reviewTime": "03 23, 2002"}

In EVIL UNDER THE SUN, beautiful but brainless Arlena Marshall is strangled on a beach, and the most obvious suspect appears to be Captain Marshall, her husband, who was jealous of her relationship with young, handsome Patrick Redfern.  While the police are eager to convict Marshall, Poirot (as usual) concerns himself with the case's psychological aspect, asking himself who at the resort is the true focus of evil:  Arlena (as everyone else assumes) or somebody else?  When Poirot finds the answer to this question, then he will have found Arlena's killer.  As always, Poirot's logic is brilliant; in fact, the dialogue contains a very funny line about Poirot's eternal competition with the dim-witted \"local police.\"  Agatha Christie's one flaw is neglecting to explain the drug-smuggling thread of the mystery in tying up the loose ends of the plot in the novel's final pages.  Two bits of trivia:  EVIL UNDER THE SUN was filmed in 1982, with Peter Ustinov as Poirot, and the more recent TV adaptation of \"Triangle at Rhodes\" - another \"love triangle\" story - starring David Suchet as Poirot, borrows some dialogue from EVIL UNDER THE SUN.", "overall": 4.0, "summary": "Evil at the Jolly Roger Hotel", "unixReviewTime": 1107216000, "reviewTime": "02 1, 2005"}

One would think that vacationing with the inimitable Hercule Poirot would be motive enough to curb a murderer, but such is not the case.  This is a classic Christie mystery - a closed setting, too many likely suspects, and a unique twist at the end.Arlena Marshall was an extremely beautiful woman - the kind that men fell instantly in love with and women fell instantly into hate with.  While vacationing at the Jolly Roger, she fans the flames of rumor with the attention she pays to Patrick Redfern, a handsome and married young man.  So when Arlena's body is discovered strangled on the beach of a secluded cove, Patrick is the most obvious suspect, but he was no where near the scene of the crime when it happened.  Therefore, it must be Arlena's husband, the almost unemotional Captain Marshall, who was well aware of his wife's proclivities toward other men.  Yet he has a rock solid alibi (perhaps one that is too rock solid for Poirot's liking).  It seems obvious that Arlena was killed by a male, but there are plenty of women on the island - Patrick Redfern's scorned wife, Captain Marshall's daughter from a previous marriage and an old friend from his youth - who would've also liked to see her dead.

To my knowledge, it's been filmed twice, a rather melodramaticfeature filmstarring Peter Ustinov as the famous Belgian detective, and then more sedately with David Suchet as part of the ongoingtelevision series. It's also been adapted as avideo game!At first glance, it's a typical mystery set-up: a group of colorful characters are gathered together in an isolated area, a murder is committed, everyone has motivation, but not all have opportunity. Throw in your usual red herrings, obscure clues, false leads, and a detective that can successfully puzzle it all out, and you have a perfect whodunit.Hercule Poirot is enjoying a sunny holiday at the Jolly Roger Hotel, built on the idyllic Smuggler's Island. Around him the talkative guests sunbathe, gossip, knit, swim and watch each other. An observer of human nature, Poirot is in his element, and it's with interest (but little surprise) that everyone's attention is on Arlena Marshall, a retired but beautiful film actress, who revels in the attention. Tall, slender and bronzed, with curly red hair and oozing sex appeal, all the men are left dumbstruck in Arlena's presence, whilst the women gnash their teeth in disapproval. Not even Poirot is left unaffected by her beauty, but he's amply aware of the chaos that the woman is causing.The man-eating Arlena enjoys toying with men, and currently has her hooks into Patrick Redfern, a young man who seems completely under her spell. The fact Arlena is a married woman and that Patrick's young, distressed wife is watching her husband engage in an affair right before her eyes, seems of little importance to Arlena.Naturally, she ends up dead, and having already engaged in conversation with a rather fanatical reverent in which both men acknowledge that there is evil everywhere under the sun, Poirot is not hugely surprised to hear that Arlena has been strangled on an isolated beach on the island known as Pixy Cove. The only access to the island is via a causeway, though the police can't rule out someone coming by boat to the isolated Pixy Cove, Poirot instinctively suspects that one of the guests is the culprit. As the last one to see Arlena alive, pushing a dingy out to sea and clearly on her way to meet somebody, Poirot begins his investigation.Who's the murderer? Everyone seemed to have a motive to kill her, from a resentful stepdaughter, a cuckolded husband, a jilted lover, a jealous wife, a romantic rival with designs on Arlena's husband...or was it something less personal? Was she the target of a religious fanatic? Did she disturb drug-dealers using Pixy Cove as a drop-off point? Was she being blackmailed? The possibilities keep piling up, as do the obscure clues scattered about: a bottle thrown out of a window, a pair of scissors on a beach, a bath drawn in the middle of the day - it all means something only to Poirot.The atmosphere of \"Evil Under the Sun\" is brilliant; after first introducing the island as the home of a reclusive captain who never had a family, the story starts some years later after his house has been renovated into a resort (and most copies of the book even come with a map of the island). Despite the warm sunshine and sandy beaches, Christie infuses the book with a clammy sense of foreboding, danger, and even - evil.
